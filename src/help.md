## "Help!"

All I can say is don't sweat it. Try to find a way to use this guide in a nice low stress way. Don't angst out about something being hard. Some things just take time.

If you still don't know what to do, or you came back here confused:

- Start learning the hiragana and katakana outside this guide.
- Start studying vocabulary outside this guide.
- Don't think that kanji are words, that makes everything confusing.
- Remind yourself that japanese is not similar to english word-by-word.
- A lot of concepts will not make sense in terms of literal english.
- You can't acquire a language without consuming it.
- Until you read enough, some things just won't click.
- Always keep moving forward. That's what gives you the language.

Do not memorize this guide. It won't work. It might even be bad for you.

Still stuck? Give a look to [Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar), the original gangsta online, permissive, not-like-a-textbook japanese grammar guide. Reading explanations about the same thing in different places can make it easier to understand.
