Copy and redistribute this guide at will. If there's an error in this guide, fix it. That's what freedom's all about.


If there's something important and basic that this guide does not cover, please complain about it on the daily japanese threads on 4chan's /jp/ board or /int/ board. However, Sakubi hasn't been actively maintained since late 2017. No major changes will be made to the version on this site. Someone else will need to adopt the guide on a different site for any more major changes to be made. If they do, I'll link to it.
