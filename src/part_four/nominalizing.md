#### Lesson 31: Generic nouns and nominalization with 事, 物, ところ, and の


事 こと and 物 もの both mean "thing". 事 is generally used for intangibles like actions or states, and 物 is generally used for tangibles like objects.


> 私のこと知らないの？ D'ya not know about me?
>
> 可愛いもの好き I like cute things.

所 ところ is a word that means "place", and is used in similar patterns, including ones about intangible places like places in time or progress, and facets/aspects of an entity. Singling out an abstract point in time is extremely flexible, and can imply things like completion, change in state, etc.


> 彼女は珍しいところもある There's some unusual points to her, too.
>
> 同情したところで、過去はもう―― Even if I had felt the same, the past is already... ("By the point I felt the same, ...")

All three of these generic nouns can turn entire phrases into nouns. This lets japanese use phrases like things without using embedded clauses. This is basically a special simplified case of the relative clauses we learned about in lesson 11.


> そんなもののために死ぬことはない
>
> There's no dying for such a thing.
>
> (Metaphorically, "There is not to die for the purpose of such a thing")
>
>
> このところ夜は
>
> Recent nights
>
>
> 事件なんかあったものね
>
> Well, some kind of incident happened.

Both of these uses extend to の for some reason.


> 赤いのはいいよ
>
> The red one is fine.
>
>
> いつ使用するのがいいですか
>
> When should I use it?
>
> (Metaphorically, "When is using good?")

This use of の is the reason の is used in のだ.
