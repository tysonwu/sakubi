#### Lesson 26: Sentence ending particles with ね, な, よ, ぜ, ぞ, わ, さ


These are particles that go at the end of statements to show how the speaker feels. The descriptions below are not literal. That is, the given explanation isn't the reason a speaker would actually use the particle. They're just a way to represent the underlying tone. You gotta acquire them yourself.


ね feels as though the speaker wants the listener to agree. When ね comes at the beginning of a sentence, it serves to get attention.


> いい天気だね It's good weather, ey?  
> > ね、来るの？ Hey, are you coming?

な indicates emphasis. Note that there's a different sentence-ender that can conflict with this one, and in such places, this one is usually written with the vowel elongated somehow, and the other normally.


> いいなぁ That's good, huh.

よ feels as though the speaker expects other people to know what the speaker knows, or that the speaker wants to share their care.


> いいよ It's fine.  
> > 彼が犬だよ He's a dog! (not surprised)

ぞ indicates assertion, but it's not necessarily impolite. It feels slightly non-feminine.


> 誰もいないぞ Nobody's here, man.  
> > 行くぞ！ A'ight, let's head out! (speaking about himself, to himself)

ぜ is like ぞ but feels more lighthearted. In fact, it can turn otherwise assertive statements into suggestions.


> いいだぜ！ It's nice!

Note that adding ぜ to だ makes だぜ act like a compound sentence ending particle, which is the only reason だ is allowed to attach to いい here. This can happen when using other particles with だ, too, not just ぜ.


わ is an exclamation. It usually feels as though the speaker is confident in what they're saying, but not forceful. In stories, it's usually feminine, but sometimes it acts like a "gender enhancer" instead, even for dudeish soldiers.


> 元気ですわよ！ I'm feeling good!

さ tries to induce optimism, or it hopes the listener will take it easy. さ can also introduce a sentence, just like ね.


> 犬がいないさ There's no dogs here, see?  
> > 早く起きなくてさ I didn't get up early, and, well.  
> > さぁ、見てみる Well, let's see.

Finally, looking back at だぜ, we can finally say that the reason です is allowed to attach to い-adjectives is because です itself acts like a sentence-ending particle.
*(To students of grammar: these are "modal particles".)*
