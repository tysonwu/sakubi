#### Lesson 28: Question nouns: なに, だれ, どれ, いつ


These are called interrogatives. They're used in order to ask wh-questions. These words can't be used as relative clause markers like english does in "The person who was fine with it". They also show up as parts of larger grammatical words.

何 なに "what"


> 何するの？
>
> Whatcha doin'?

誰 だれ "who"


> 誰だ！
>
> Who's there!
>
>
>
> 誰？
>
> ho?
>
>
>
> 誰ですか
>
> Who is it?

どれ basically "which"


> どれがいいかなぁ
>
> I wonder which one would be good.

いつ "when" (not "while" or "at the time that")


> いつがいいか
>
> When's good?
>
>
>
> いつから君がいた、ここ？
>
> How long have you been here?
>
> (metaphorically, "Since when were you here?")

Japanese is a "wh-in-situ" language, which just means that it doesn't need to move interrogatives around in wh-questions like english does.
