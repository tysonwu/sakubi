#### Lesson 30: Saying yes and no with うん, ううん, はい, いいえ, ええ, and いや


The exact situations where different yes/no words are used are pretty much entirely dependent on convention. As such, the rules are too complicated to teach. But I can give a rundown of the common yes/no words anyway.


> うん - Yep (casual)  
> > ううん - Nope (casual)

うん and ううん have completely different tones of voice when spoken.


> はい - Yes (general use)  
> > いいえ - No (polite)  
>   
> > ええ - Yeah (informal, kind)  
> > いや - No (rough)

Warning: ええ can be an unrelated filler word that feels like the speaker has something to elaborate on or deny, or that they're confused.


In addition to "no", 嫌 いや is also a な-adjective used for unlikeable things.


> 嫌だ! いやだ！ No!  
> > 嫌なことしないでください Please don't do something bad.

いや can also be said as や. This usually isn't done if it'd be confusing.
