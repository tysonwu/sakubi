#### Lesson 25: Adverbs with と-adverbs, に-adverbs, and い-adjectives even


Adverbs are words that modify the nature of an event. In english, the "liberally" in "Please add sugar liberally" is an adverb. In japanese, adverbs don't inflect like adjectives and verbs do, though you can inflect them before turning them into adverbs.


Japanese has "true" adverbs that can be used with no special marking at all, in addition to other kinds of adverbs.


> 全く光のない Entirely without light
>
> 全然駄目だ It's no use at all

と-adverbs are words that take と when used as an adverb.


> 自然と殺す Kill naturally/spontaneously/by nature
>
> 次々と出てきます They're coming out one after the other.

に-adverbs are words that take に when used as an adverb. In fact, except for a few fixed phrases, almost all に-adverbs are nouns of some sort, usually な-adjectives. This is where に turns into an adverbial marker for nouns. A bunch of expressions that are considered grammar features are just nouns with relative clauses on the left side and an adverbial に on the right side.


> 自由に研究する Study freely
>
> 特別にいいです It's particularly good

い-adjectives can be used as adverbs by replacing the い with a く.
早く起きる Get up early
Adverbs sometimes take する to construct an action about the adverb. This is similar to how the negative form of い-adjectives (e.g. 赤くない) puts く before ない.


> 広々としている It's spacious.
>
> 確りして Hang in there / Stay frosty / Get a hold of yourself

*(To students of grammar: the use of に as an "adverbial" marker for nouns might have a different etymology than the use of に as an oblique case marker. It might correspond to the defective Old Japanese copula n- \*ni/no2/nite.)*
