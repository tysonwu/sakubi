#### Lesson 10: Being more with で, では, and じゃ


Normally, で marks the "circumstance" or "means" behind an action. Circumstance can be a location.


> 剣で出来ている  
> > Is made out of swords  
>   
> > 刀で殺した  
> > Killed (others) with a katana  
>   
> > バスで来た  
> > Came by bus  
>   
> > 学校で働く  
> > Working at school

で comes from contracting にて. You see にて in old fashioned writing.


で can also be used like it's the て "particle" of だ. It's not **actually** the て "particle" of だ, but it's close enough for japanese grammar to say it is.


> 私は彼が本当に犬で慌てる  
> > He's really a dog and I'm flustered.  
> > (I'm flustered that he's really a dog.)

This brings us to では. では is a compound particle. The は here is the topic marker, but では's meaning isn't defined as the sum of its parts. では marks the circumstance or condition of another state.


> 公園ではアイスが売られる  
> > Ice cream is sold at the park.

This extends to state of being.


> 私は学生ではない  
> > I am not a student.

The conversational version of the above uses じゃ, a contraction of では.


> 私は学生じゃない  
> > I'm not a student.

Because it's not contracted, ではない is a low grade formal negative assertion. In fact, じゃない is basically the negative version of だ. The etymology of だ has で in it, but we'll learn that etymology later.


Some dialects have different normal spoken copulas than だ. Examples are や and じゃ. This じゃ is a contraction of something other than では. では is not a copula.


> ペンじゃ  
> > 'ts a pen. (it's a pen.)
