#### Intermission: Consonant irregularity

_Intermissions are optional._

_The italic text in this intermission will indicate values in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Letters)._

The consonant g is sometimes pronounced ng, even at the beginning of words. In modern times, this is a matter of accent, not variation between dialects. It feels prestigious, not slangy, but it's being phased out.

The syllable ん is **always** pronounced as m before "p" and "b", **always** pronounced as ng (_ŋ_) before "k" and "g", and **always** pronounced like ng (_ɴ_) at the end of an utterance. Basically, it merges with whatever comes after it, just like how the "input" is usually pronounced "imput", and "inking" as "ingking".

Most japanese syllables use the consonants regularly. Only a couple don't.

Within the basic kana, only the kana ふ, つ, し, and ち have irregular consonant sounds. They are, in effect, "fu" (_ɸu_), "tsu", "shi" (_ɕi_), and "chi" (_t͡ɕi_), in order.

When they're voiced, three of the four irregular basic kana, づ, じ, and ぢ, change qualities slightly. So does ず.

In standard japanese, ず and づ are in free variation. Either one can be pronounced as dzu or zu.

The same is true with じ and ぢ pronounced as ji (_ʑi_) (as in the second consonant in "vision") or dji (_d͡ʑi_) (as in the first consonant in "James").

ず・づ and じ・ぢ being treated the same way is a feature of the standard accent. Other accents can merge the four of them together even more, or not merge them at all.

When し, ち, じ, and ぢ start diphthongs, like ちゃ, ぢゃ, しゃ, and じゃ, the "i/y" sound in the middle is dropped. For example, ちゃ is **always** pronounced as "cha" (_t͡ɕa_), never as "chya" (_t͡ɕja_). Normal diphthongs like きゃ are pronounced the normal way, like "kya" (_kja_).
