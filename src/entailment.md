#### Lesson 44: Entailment with から そして ので で


から, not just a case particle, is also a conjunction where the thing after から is "because of" the thing before から. This is called entailment.


いいから止まれ It's fine, so stop.
から is only an interjection in compounds such as だから and ですから. Keep in mind that だから and ですから can occur naturally when から is a conjunction too.


犬だから怖い It's scary because it's a dog.
そして is an interjection that essentially means "therefore". It has a tone similar to "therefore" too, maybe polite rather than formal.


そして起きなかった Therefore he didn't wake up.
ので acts like から. However, ので is allowed in fewer situations than から. ので wants both statements to be real statements, not invitation or conjecture. This narrows down the ways you can interpret the statement in.


実家に帰ったので Because I returned to where I grew up.
ので for nouns is なので, not だので. ので and のだ are related, which is why のだ has the nuance "the reason for something". The more you know.


ので is more "objective" and has less emphasis than other adversatives, which means that it's sometimes used to link two statements that just so happen to have a cause/effect relationship.


で can be used as a conjunction similar to "so". The meaning here is more of a feeling and less of a literal meaning. で is deep in the "academic papers" feeling if it's formal, but it can also be used in rough spoken japanese.


で、おまえは誰だ So just who are you?
This で is the て "particle" of だ. It's the で in the conjunction でも, where も changes it from marking entailment to being adversative.


Words like これ and それ can be combined with conjunctive particles like で (but not limited to で) to narrow down where the entailment is coming from.


それで、ツインテールになる？ You'll become twintails, then?
Things like それから also exist and have their own nuances.
