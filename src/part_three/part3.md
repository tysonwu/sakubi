### Part 3: The Gauntlet


Some things you just have to get out of the way before you can go on.


Even if they're annoying.



#### Lesson 19: Passive られる・あれる and so-called "transitive pairs"


Passive verbs exist to turn the logical object of a verb into the grammatical subject. Unlike てある, passives describe the action, rather than making a statement about an enduring state left by that action.


Five-form and one-form verbs form the passive in different ways. Five-form verbs take the negative stem and replace ない with れる, the passive suffix. One-form verbs take the *one and only base* and add ら, \*then\* add れる. Basically, for regular verbs, you replace the last u with an a and add れる, unlike negatives where one-form verbs drop the る entirely instead of just the u.


食べられる  

殺される  

  

殺された人間の死体 The dead bodies of people who were killed.  

魚が食べられた The fish got eaten.
The person who logically performs an action is called the "agent". If you want to state the agent of a passive verb, you usually use に, but for certain phrases, から is also acceptable. This calls back to に being a general fallback for the secondary arguments of a verb.


魚が猫に食べられた The fish was eaten by a cat.
In grammar study, there's a concept of verbal "transitivity", which basically just has to do with whether the verb accepts a normal direct object or not. We already learned that "intransitive" verbs describe a state if you attach ている.


彼を教えた I taught him. (transitive)  

彼が死ぬ He dies. (intransitive)
"Transitive pairs" are pairs of japanese verbs that represent the same action, but one is transitive, and the other is not. Unlike passives, intransitive verbs in a "transitive pair" don't usually accept marking an agent with に.


上げる to raise something  

上がる for something to rise  

  

見る to see  

見える for something to be seen/visible


#### Intermission: Notes on the passive


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


Sometimes から is used for the agent of a passive verb. This shows a difference in nuance. から is sometimes unacceptable.


Keigo loves passives. You're on your own here.


Adjectives are inherently intransitive and stateful. This even applies to ones that *look* logically transitive, like 好き.


English has a couple transitive pairs, like raise/rise and lay/lie, but modern spoken english is trying to merge these together, since modern spoken english doesn't care that much about transitivity anymore (I blew up the car vs The car blew up). This merge is not happening in japanese.




#### Lesson 20: Potential れる・える and できる


The potential form exists so that people can say that something "can be done". For five-form verbs, the u is replaced with an e, then added る. So "u" -> "eru". For one-form verbs, it's identical to the passive. Do you hate one-form verbs yet?


食べられる  

食べれる (!)  

殺せる  

死ねる  

ありえる
To explain what's going on here, I have to dump some **really** annoying information on you, so sorry not sorry. Don't worry if your eyes gloss over trying to read it, that's normal. Just read it and move on.


The long form for one-form verbs, 食べられる is the "correct" way to make a potential one-form verb. However, the short form, 食べれる, shows up all the time colloquially, and has done so for a long time, both because it's more regular with five-form verbs and because the long form is obviously ambiguous.


Unfortunately, if context doesn't make it obvious, gut feeling is the only way to know whether a given appearance of one-form られる is passive or potential or both.


In addition to the one-form's ambiguity problem, every passive form can mean the potential sometimes. It's up to you to figure out whether a given use of the passive means a passive, a passive-potential, or just a potential.


*A million eyes gloss over in annoyance.*


ありえる is irregular and is always potential.


Now we can talk about 出来る できる, a one-form verb that means "made" or "completed". It does double duty as する's potential.


出来る 出来ない 出来た 出来ます  

  

昨日は勉強できなかった Yesterday I couldn't study.  

  

できません I can't.  

*(In english, "can not" and "cannot" are assertive in speech. できません isn't, so the contraction is appropriate despite ます)*

私は日本語出来ない (unintelligible dysfluent gagging)


#### Intermission: Notes on the potential


*Intermissions are optional.*


Traditional japanese grammar says that the passive and potential are blurry in general, even for five-form verbs, but it's only a matter of time before they're not. A doubled-up form, as in 食べれられる, is already in very common colloquial use. I've been told it's feminine.


In any case, if you see one of the five-form potentials or the one-form short potential, you can be 99.9999% sure it doesn't mean the passive.


The short potential is sometimes homophonous with an existing strictly "passive" intransitive verb that comes from the same root transitive word, like 切れる. In these cases, you just have to stay frosty.


The five-form verbs' potential form might come from the stem used with the polite (ます) form, plus 得る える, a verb that normally means "get" but here means "is possible". The -ie sequence would contract to -e, except for ありえる.


As a side note, the five-form -eru potentials predate the one-form short potential, which is probably why they're more accepted.




#### Lesson 21: Wanting with おう/よう, たい, and ほしい


In this section, we're learning three of the ways that japanese expresses desire.


The "volitional" form, おう/よう, says that you want to or will do something, or invites volition in other people like "let's X". It's also used in compound constructions about volitional action. The volitional form of five-form verbs is -ou, and the volitional form of one-form verbs is よう. It's pronounced with a "long o", not お plus う.


行こう Let's head out.  

行こうか How about we go?  

食べようと思う I think I'll eat.
With copulas, it usually "invites an idea", like conjecture or possibility.


いいでしょう It's good, don't you think? (おう form of です)  

犬だろうと、猫だろうと、なんでも問題ありません Perhaps dogs, perhaps cats; whatever way, there's no problem. (*おう form of だ, contraction of であろう*)
The second way to express desire is たい. たい is an い-adjective that attaches the same way as ます. Like てある, たい turns the phrase intransitive.


死にたい I want to die.  

アイスが食べたい I want to eat icecream.  

(metaphorically "icecream is wanted to be eaten")
Despite making the verb become intransitive, spoken japanese can use を with たい. This is sometimes considered incorrect, but it doesn't feel wrong. The one that logically wants to do the action can't be marked with を.


昨日は君がタイヤキを食べたいと思う I thought yesterday you wanted taiyaki.  

(metaphorically "yesterday, you were wanting to eat taiyaki")
たい can go at the end of entire phrases that retain their full internal structure. This applies to a lot of other verb forms too, like てある, but たい is hard enough that this should be pointed out directly.


The final way of wanting is 欲しい ほしい, an い-adjective meaning "wanted".


アイスがほしい I want ice cream (metaphorically "ice cream is wanted")
ほしい is also used as an auxiliary adjective (just like an auxiliary verb) meaning that you want something to happen. If you include the agent that you want to do the thing, you usually mark it with に.


あなたに英語を教えてほしい I want you to teach me english.
てほしい can also be used like the below example. This isn't the only situation where が can be used with てほしい.


じゃあ今、私が何してほしいかわかる？  

Well then, understand what I want you to do now?
Be careful to make sure that the が is actually marking the first person in cases like that. In the following example, が marks the subject of a relative clause, not the subject of the main verb with ほしい on it.


そなたが見た事を伝えてほしい  

I want you to convey what you saw on your end. (crappy translation)
Supposedly, が can mark the agent of the desired action in more situations than this, but I haven't found any examples.




#### Intermission: Notes on wanting


*Intermissions are optional.*


The volitional form おう/よう comes from a sound change from "au" (as in the sound a, followed by the sound u) to "ou" (as in a long o). The original form was e.g. 見やう and 死なう, but remember that classical japanese verbal conjugation is **very** different than what it is today.


As such, the お in the five-form base used to actually be an あ, meaning that the five-form verbs were four-form verbs. You see "yodan" in some english grammar writing about japanese because of this. But they have been called "godan", five-form, for a very long time. Normal japanese people are not taught the term yodan anymore.


About たい. 見たい みたい mean "seems", not just "wants to look". No matter what grammar you're looking at, some expressions work outside the normal rules. It's vital for you to think about what things mean in context, not just what their parts imply. In the case of みたい, the "seems" meaning is usually in kana and follows a verb, but not every exception is predictable like みたい.


死んだみたい Looks like he died


#### Lesson 22: One way of saying "if" with ば


Verbs have a ば form that turns them into a condition. The conjugation turns the u at the end of a verb into an e, then adds ば. Basically, for five-form verbs, you replace the u with an e, and for one-form verbs, you add れ after the *one and only base*.


見れば死ぬ If I look I'll die.  

殺せばいいかなぁ I suppose it would be fine if I killed him.
ば implies that the condition is sufficient for and implies its result, a logical "if". This can even be used for certain requests, like "If you're late, just call and I'll handle everything".


ば doesn't imply that the condition will happen, so it won't be used in things like "When you come around, come see me". We'll see other conjunctions that're appropriate for that later.




#### Intermission: The Gauntlet


*Intermissions are optional.*


This is the last intermission. You've almost made it through the gauntlet. After the next lesson, you're through. Keep it up.


For a piece of trivia, ば comes from the topic marker, は. The h- syllables used to be pronounced with a p, which is why their voiced versions use a b. The topic marker is an edge case where a p evolved into a w instead of an h.




#### Lesson 23: Verbs review


We've finally run into all of the basic stems of the five-form verbs, so this is a good time to review what we've learned. Please don't try to memorize this. Knowing that these ideas exist is enough. If your eyes gloss over, relax. If you can't do it, move on.


The names given on the left are plain english representations of the japanese names. Where needed, the japanese names have alternative translations. If a form/base/stem is referred to in the rest of the guide, I'll use the plain english name, not the japanese name.


死な "none such" form ("as if it has not yet happened" 未然形)  

死の tentative form   

死に verb-sticky form (連用形)  

死ん verb-sticky form (連用形) (reduced)  

死ぬ terminal form (終止形)  

死ね "some such" form ("as if it were so" 已然形 / "hypothetical" 仮定形)  

死ね imperative form (命令形)
If you count, you'll identify that the base stem "shi-n" (which ends on a consonant) inflects to each of the five japanese vowels. This is what "five-form" means.


Four-form, or 四段 "yodan", shows up regularly in english writing on japanese grammar, but japanese natives literally aren't even taught the word anymore.


One-form verbs look like so:


食べ "none such" form ("as if it has not yet happened" 未然形)  

食べ tentative form \*  

食べ verb-sticky form (連用形)  

食べる terminal form (終止形)  

食べれ "some such" form ("as if it were so" 已然形 / "hypothetical" 仮定形)  

食べろ imperative form (命令形)
*\* The よ isn't part of this base. 食べよ alone is an alternative imperative.*


As you can see, there's a lot more irregularity here, but the verb's base kana stem never changes, hence the name one-form. The *one and only base*.


This is the set of classical bases, aside from modernization: including the reduced verb-sticky form and the tentative, and excluding the attributive.


The "none such" form is used for negatives, passives, and some condition expressions. It's also the etymology of the tentative form.


The tentative form is the base of the volitional/hortative ～おう/よう forms.


The terminal form is, for normal dictionary verbs, the plain "non-past" tense.


The verb-sticky form is used for most of the complex verb conjugations in japanese, including the ます form, past, て form, たい form, etc.


The "some such" form is used in some conditions and is sometimes considered the base of the short potentials.


The imperative form is an imperative form. It forms rough commands.


Traditional japanese grammar analyzes the long potential form of one-form verbs as られる itself attached to the base stem, not れる attached to a ら. There's no difference between the two interpretations.


The only reason for the one-form verbs to have a 未然形 form, in addition to the identical verb-sticky form, is so that grammarians don't need to give one-form verbs their own rule for the negative. Yes, it's silly.




#### Hidden Intermission


*Intermissions are optional.*


The redundancy of the classical stems, and the fact that they don't cover everything about modern japanese conjugation without additional rules, is why the classical categorization is not used much anymore, except as a reference. The names it introduced are still used though.


Alexander Vovin, a salient academic linguist, considers the 未然形 form to be a figment of [structuralizing classical japanese grammar](https://www.academia.edu/12981120/). I think he's on to something, which is the reason I translated it as the "none such" form. The best part is "none such" is valid translation of 未然 if you think hard enough.


The only reason I named the 已然形/仮定形 form "some such" instead of "hypothetical" is because the stems on their own don't do much in modern japanese, and I wanted to avoid implying that it acts hypothetical on its own. In modern japanese, the "none such" and "some such" forms are basically incomplete and expect something to be attached to them.


[There are other reasons to be careful with classical japanese grammar.](http://no-sword.jp/blog/2005/10/classical-japanese-verb-categories-are.html)


Japanese school grammar cares a lot about the classical bases, and they have their place in the modern interpretation of classical grammar, but they're not *all* useful anymore.


I should emphasize that the 未然形 has real uses of its own in classical japanese. The contention comes from conflating all -a forms of (back then) 四段 verbs with the 未然形 category name, which is named such because of a particular use of it. Modern linguistics treats categories as things that happen when you *use* words, or as features of "universal grammar", and applying categories too widely causes a lot of problems when grammar people try talking to eachother. The 未然形 category is a legitimate description of a real grammatical feature of classical japanese, but the name doesn't fit all uses of the stem.
