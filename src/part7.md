### Part 7: Relatively speaking


Tomorrow, the world is in danger. For the sake of time, for the sake of a new today, you have to stop someone from going back to the world of yesterday.



#### Lesson 48: Expectation with わけ, はず, べき, べし, ものだ, かもしれない


わけ is a noun meaning "reason" (as in "why"). At the end of a statement, it says a reason for something was identified through deduction/judgment.


Use one: the speaker knows something that's relevant, and they're making a statement to put emphasis on the fact that it's true and relevant right now. According to that fact or reason, something else is to be expected.


つまり、私たちは餌というわけですね  

Basically, it's a matter of fact that we're food.  

(There's a reason to know that we're food)
You can imagine that they're in trouble or there's something wrong with them.


Use two: one thing leads to another, based on fact. When negated, you can think of it as a way to refute an expectation that didn't follow good reasoning.


魔術師の家系の子供は、それだけで魔術に適した人間ってわけ。  

That reason alone is why the children of magical lineages are suited to magic.  

  

年齢でクラスが決まってるわけじゃないの。  

There's no reason for classes to be decided based on age.
はず expresses that the speaker expects something to factually be true or come true. The english "should" expresses both this and "subjective" expectation, i.e. that it would be bad otherwise, so it's not a 1:1 match. はず also implies that the expectation is based on reasoning and is not pure conjecture.


高かったはずだ It must've been expensive.  

優しいはずだ She should be kind. (I'm pretty sure she's kind)
べき states that the speaker expects a certain action or state, because otherwise it would be bad, irresponsible, etc.


When in the past tense like べきだった (or similar), it says that an action or state "was" or "would have been" right, usually the latter.


べし is an archaic version of べき. You're unlikely to run into it, but you never know with fiction.


ものだ can also express "should" with the nuance that it's a general "should" that applies to a lot of people, not just a specific person or a group. This only applies when it's being used for mood reasons, just like のだ. You should also watch out for ものを, another confusing use of もの.


かもしれない is a compound sentence-ending particle. It attaches the same way as か alone does. It expresses that the speaker thinks the statement is a possibility. Sometimes people attach this to things they know are true for politeness's sake.


悪質ではあるかもしれないけど―― Though it may be volatile...


#### Lesson 49: Approximately ころ, くらい, たり, and limits with まで, ほど, すぎる


ころ is a noun that basically means "approximate time". You run into Xのころに a lot. This can either be a conjunction "around the time of X", or a noun "the general time when X" with the に particle attached.


When it acts as a suffix, ころ is voiced, becoming ごろ. ごろ attaches to a noun that takes a "specific point in time" (not a length of time) and makes it be vague and approximate. In any case, it shouldn't be used with nonspecific spans of time that are already vague.


くらい・ぐらい takes a span and makes it approximate. 三か月ぐらい basically means "for around three months". くらい can also be used to compare things like より, and says that they're about the same.


たり is used to list statements in an inexhaustive and nonspecific way, much like the listing particle や. It attaches the same way as the past tense, so it can come out as だり, and sometimes it's treated like <past>+り.


まで essentially means "up to" or "until". Unlike "until" (like "until friday"), まで does not explicitly exclude what it marks.


月曜日から金曜日まで  

Monday through friday (including monday and friday)
まで can be used with verb phrases, but it can only be attached to informal, tenseless statements. In other words, they have to be plain and not past tense.


Reality check: までに is a compound particle meaning "at some time before" rather than "to the point through".


ほど essentially means "as" in terms of a comparison. For some left-hand arguments of ほど, the statement being compared has to be negative. In such comparisons, ほど acts as a limit on how well the statement applies.


君ほど強くない Not as strong as you
In positive statements where ほど attaches to an "amount", it's approximate.


半分ほど食べた I ate around half.
Compounds like それほど act as their own thing and have different semantics than their parts combined. それほど means something like "that much".


過ぎる すぎる is a verb and means "exceed" or "surpass". As an auxiliary verb, すぎる means "too much" or an excess, and attaches to the verb-sticky form.


食べすぎる Eating too much  

優しすぎる Too kind


#### Lesson 50: Doing the time with 後, 前/先, 時 (note さっき)


後・あと is a noun that means "after". X後で is a conjunction saying that something happens after X, and not necessarily immediately.


前・まえ is an antonym of 後 and means "before". 前 can both mean before in the spatial sense (i.e. in front of you) and in the time sense (i.e. the past). This is unintuitive because of the notion of "putting the past behind you", but if you remember that "People in front of you in line are Before Your Presence and Do Things Before You", you'll do fine.


The conjunction X前に means something happens before X does, not necessarily immediately. X前に can also just be a noun acting as the argument of a verb, in which case it means "in front of" in the spatial sense.


前 and 先 are almost synonyms.


先 is a noun meaning "before", "ahead", or "front end". Generally, when 先 is spatial, it means the front ("head") of something, or the direction it's headed, not the location immediately in front of it.


先 has two contradictory temporal uses.


Temporal use one means that something is ahead of something else, right now. A teacher is ahead of a student in life. It could also be something that happened just a moment ago.


Temporal use two means that something lies ahead, in the future. A career lies ahead of a student.


These uses seem contradictory, but they have the same fundamental idea. The contradiction only happens when you give the word "before" in some situations and "ahead" in others. English does the same thing and it's just as confusing.


This is a convenient way to remember that 先 doesn't arbitrarily change between being a word for temporal past and future. Instead, it depends on the situation or phrase, just like the english word "ahead".


The conjunction X先に works almost exactly the same way as X前に.


さっき is a version of 先 that is exclusively used as a "moment ago" time noun.


時 is a noun that means "time", but if you give it a relative clause, it can act like a conjunction.


また繋げたい時は言ってね  

Tell me when you want to connect again, 'kay?


#### Lesson 51: Likeness with らしい ぽい そう など


らしい is an auxiliary adjective that attaches to nouns or verbs/adjectives and says that something factually "seems so" based on circumstance. らしい is appropriate for things that would translate to "seems X", rather than "Xish".


ぽい (almost always っぽい) says that something subjectively "seems so" based on appearance or properties and translates well as "Xish" or "X-like".


We've seen そう before in a couple example sentences with the pattern "そうだ", where we translated it as "is so", where "so" meant "like that". That's a literal use of そう as a noun. There are two grammatical constructions that use そう that have a different meaning than just "like that".


Use one is "seeming", where そう attaches directly to a verb or adjective's stem, including な-adjectives (where the stem just lacks the な・だ). This is sometimes used like "seems like I will X" with non-volitional future actions. Notably, A Frequency Dictionary of Japanese interprets that as "about to X".


食べられそう  

Seems edible
Use two is "hearsay", much like らしい, except that it attaches to statements rather than individual words. If you want, you can think of this as "it seems that \_\_\_" until it clicks in your head.


Finally, など basically means "etc", "and so on", or "and the like". Sometimes it's the final grammatical word in a list, especially vague or non-exhaustive ones, and it can turn exhaustive, concrete types of lists into non-exhaustive ones, without changing the nuance.


謝罪など、全く無用の事です Apologies and such, very much useless things.


#### Lesson 52: Being done for someone with やる あげる もらう くれる


As a normal verb, やる is highly contextual, and you might as well treat it like its meaning depends on the structure it's in. It's a "do" word, but it's more general than する, and it has different connotations.


As an auxiliary verb, やる expresses that the action was in some way undesirable to someone involved, like doing something at their expense.


ケーキを食べてやった  

I ate the cake (at someone's expense)  

  

怒鳴り付けてやった  

I shouted at him (even though he wouldn't want it)
あげる is a "give" word. In the structure てあげる, it means that someone did the action "for the sake of" someone else. But there's a catch: When it's the core of the independent statement itself, and not hidden away inside a relative clause or modified in such a way, it never refers to an action done for the sake of the speaker (nor for the sake of someone the speaker is speaking for).


There's no good term for this, but a new one that might gain some traction is "private predicate". If the speaker (or someone they're speaking for) is the person receiving the good will of the action, and the action isn't embedded or relative, the speaker can't use てあげる. A native japanese speaker will refuse, on a grammatical level, to think that the speaker is the receiver.


This is a way of avoiding ambiguity when talking about giving and receiving with dropped subjects. But even with an explicit subject, you can't use the speaker as the receiver of てあげる. You need to use くれる instead.


もらう is similar to あげる, but means "getting" instead of "giving".


もらう almost acts like a passive. The receiver of the action is marked as the subject and not the indirect object. This is what it means when I say it refers to "getting" and not "giving". もらう is also the opposite of あげる in that the speaker cannot be the giver of the action.


The speaker will not be marked as the indirect object of a もらう or あげる statement that the speaker is making, even though the speaker has different roles in both kinds of statements.


あげる is sometimes used when the giver and receiver are both third parties. Then the speaker is implying that they empathize with whoever was giving.


もらう means the receiver is the speaker or someone they empathize with.


くれる is a "give" word, but it works like the opposite of あげる. The speaker (or their party) must be the one receiving the action, and cannot be marked as the giver. When the speaker is the giver, あげる has to be used.


When the giver or receiver is not stated explicitly, you need to understand the rules above in order to understand who's playing what role. That's the only reason I bothered to explain what's going on. If it's hard to understand, skip it, try to learn it through exposure, and maybe come back here later.


Some linguists consider this a special case of subject-verb agreement. If you come from a language with pervasive subject-verb agreement, that might be a more intuitive way to think about this for you. But I don't know how well the idea fits, so if you want to think about this like agreement, be careful, I don't know what to warn you about.




#### Lesson 53: Wrongness with だめ, いけない, ならない, featuring "must", and bonus, some contractions


だめ is a word that means something like "no good", "useless", or "no use". It can be used to say that a statement would be bad, after turning the statement into a noun or a conjunction.


ならない and いけない similar to だめ, but they're strong enough to say that something is prohibited.


ならない and いけない are relatively common, because they're used in a very common double negative construction that means "must".


なければならない
There are several variations on this. They boil down to "not to X" "wrong".


なければならない  

なければいけない  

ねばならない  

ねばならぬ  

なかったらいけない  

なくてはいけない  

etc.
Different ways of forming it have different flavors, levels of strength, and implications about why or in what way it must be done.


ならない is slightly stronger than いけない. ならない has the connotation of mental things that make something undoable, and いけない has the connotation of something being prohibited, but this distinction is in no way objective, and doesn't represent how japanese natives think about it.


On the topic of there being a million ways to say something, there are some contractions that you have to watch out for if you don't have a lot of experience reading. Here are a few. Contractions that were explicitly explained elsewhere in this guide, they aren't listed. Always be careful about contractions in speech and dialogue.




| Phrase | Contraction |
| なにするの？ | なにすんの？ |
| なにをしてるのだ | なにをしてんだ |
| 来るな・くるな | 来んな・くんな |
| (surname)さんのうち | (surname)さんち |
| わからない | わかんない |
| わからない | わからねー |
| すごい | すげー |




#### Lesson 54: "Oh well" and "I can't help it" with "It can't be helped"


There's two basic forms of this expression, differing in whether they use よう・様 or かた・方.
しようがない・しょうがない・etc  

しかたがない・しかたない・etc
Both of them are literally し(する) + よう・かた (way to X) + [が]ない.


The literal meaning of ～よう・かたがない is "there's no way to X". しよう・かたがない can use this meaning, too, in the right context.


書きようがない No way to write
But as a set phrase, しようがない and friends are their own thing, and take on the meaning "oh well", "I can't help it", "there's no two ways about it", etc. English has a bunch of phrases for this kind of idea with different nuances.


This sort of expression shows up in every human language, but the way it's worded in japanese has been exoticized, thanks to shitty translations repeatedly using "it can't be helped".


While grammatically correct, and a valid phrase, and one that people might use in natural english, overusing "it can't be helped" in translations has basically made しようがない have a mythical status as something that has an untranslatable meaning. It's not untranslatable. Especially because many uses of しようがない just mean "there's no way to do X". Not all of them are "oh well".


There's something very important to learn here. Your dictionary is not an authority on what something **does** mean, only an authority on what something **might** mean. Just because しようがない has the translation "it can't be helped" in a dictionary, it doesn't mean that you **must** interpret it that way. What you feel like it means is more important than what your dictionary says.








#### Optional Lesson 4: Under the rug: A mess of particles and auxiliaries


These common important intermediate words aren't present in this guide. They're not present in any of the main lessons because they don't stick well into them, and because they're not particularly annoying.


Most of these are listing particles or emphatic particles that are hard to forget and easy to get a feel for. Let's sweep them under the rug.


なり can be a list marker that marks examples of possible options.


きり・っきり is a particle with two meanings.


In the pattern <noun>きり, it acts like an "only" marker.


In the pattern <statement>っきり, it basically means "ever since <statement>".


Some set phrases like 思いっきり, すっきり, てっきり, and はっきり contain the kana っきり, but aren't using the meaning described above.


やら is another particle with two meanings.


It can be used at the end of a statement to make an introspective question. This isn't just a modal particle, it can also be used in the middle of a statement, just like か.


It can also be used to list possibilities/examples, like か for alternatives.


こそ is an emphatic particle that acts a lot like stressing the word in english. In other words, it literally emphasizes whatever it attaches to. You can also think of it like "for sure" until it clicks in your head.


さえ is an emphatic particle that means "even an X", or "only an X", depending on the phrase and its polarity. まで can also be used this way, but not in negative/conditional phrases, and thus never means "only an X".


すら is a slightly literary emphatic particle very similar to さえ. すら can replace さえ when さえ means "even an X".


These sorts of "even an X" emphasis overlap with some uses of も and , which is why でも and だって were so hard to explain.


すぐ is an adverbial noun that means "immediately", either in a temporal way or in a spatial way. You can construct both "right in front of" and "right away" with it. すぐに basically means "soon".


ずつ is a particle that means "each" or "at a time". It emphasizes that the pace of something is steady, rather than just having an average rate.


がる is an auxiliary verb that means that someone other than the speaker (remember the "private predicate") shows signs of something. たがる is a combination of たい and がる, meaning someone looks like they want to do something.


がち is an auxiliary verb that means that someone or something has a tendency. The tendency is usually undesirable from an outside view.
