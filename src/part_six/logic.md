#### Optional Lesson 3: Formal logical conjunctions または, あるいは, 及び, and more

These conjunctions have their own section because they're very easy to learn by exposure when you read. They're basically words of their own. That said, please skip this lesson until you need it. Optional lessons are optional.

Every term in this lesson is usually a written construction, though they can be spoken. Also, the は at the end of a couple of these is the topic marker.

または (又は) separates mutually exclusive options. Normally, it only separates two items, but said items can be lists themselves. Note that または has complex syntax restrictions on what it can attach to.

> 来るか、または連絡する
>
> Comes, otherwise communicates
>
> 犬、または猫
>
> A dog **or**> a cat

もしくは (若しくは) is another logical conjunction meaning "or". Unlike または, it isn't specifically mutually exclusive. It just presents two alternatives.

> 死ぬか、もしくは死亡する
>
> Die, or pass away

あるいは (或いは) is another alternative-presenting conjunction, but this time it has another common use. In addition to acting like "or", it can also act like an interjection that just emphasize the possibility of something.

及び is a logical "and". It doesn't just note that both of the items apply to the statement, it notes that they apply **together**. In this way, it's similar to と (but stricter) when と is used as a logical "and". 及び is formal. Unlike と, 及び can operate on more kinds of objects.

並びに works much like 及び. 並びに can only be used with one set of two items. However, 並びに and 及び can be used together to control the order in which items are combined together.

ものの (物の) has the same general meaning as the conjunction が, but has different restrictions on when it's used. For example, ものの cannot be followed up with a question or a volitional/invitational statement.
