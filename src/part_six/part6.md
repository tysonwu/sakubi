### Part 6: Putting things together


Beware the Jabberwock, my son. A heated discussion bears only ill fruit. Dragons are proud, so letting them make you do something silly like get rat tails might humor them, but Jabberwocks compromise with noone. The only way to stop a Jabberwock is to tangle it in its own verbal gospel. Tear it apart.



#### Lesson 40: Being more negative: なくて, ないで, and ず and ずに


We briefly covered なくて and ないで before in the context of ください. Let's cover them properly.


なくて is the て "particle". When it acts as a conjunction (and not a topic), なくて usually implies that a negative statement is the reason for another statement. It doesn't *always* imply a reason, though.


早く起きなくて　仕事に遅れた
ないで can be a conjunction too. Unlike なくて, it doesn't carry the "reason" nuance. Sometimes it has the nuance that Y happens without X happening, but this is something you shouldn't worry about it till you're adept at japanese.


話せないで殺す He kills without talking.
Covered earlier, ないで is also used for conjugations like ないでください.


This calls back to the made-up distinction I made between the て "particle" and "form" early on in this guide. The て particle is "just" a conjunction, and connects two events. The て form, however, is a conjunction **or** a linking form. For verbs, they are identical, but for adjectives like ない, the two possible forms have a strict distinction, and they are not equivalent.


One way of seeing the difference between なくて and ないで is that なくて implies that, at some point in time, something specifically doesn't happen. In grammar terms, なくて is never truly an infinitive. This is the reason that なくて cannot link verbs like in ないでいる or ないでください.


Remember, て "form" vs "particle" is an abstraction. It's only meant to help you remember how なくて and ないで are different. Native japanese speakers don't literally think about なくて and ないで in this way. They have a deep and unspeakable intuition that can't be explained, no matter how hard anyone tries. When you consume enough japanese input, you'll gain the same intuition.


ず is an archaic negative suffix. It goes in place of ない, except for する where the form is せずに. It can be conjugated, but you won't see it conjugated anywhere in modern japanese, because it's fossilized and acts like a conjunction instead of something you can conjugate.


ず is essentially only used as a conjunction meaning "without \_ing". This overlaps with ないで, but there are differences in nuance.


ずに is how ず is normally used in modern japanese, but it can go either way.


一言も話さずに終わった Ended it without saying a single thing.


#### Lesson 41: If and when with と たら なら


と is used to link two events where one is a natural consequence of the other, in a strongly sequential way.


飲み続けると危ない薬 Medicine that's dangerous if you keep taking it.
たら is used to link two events where one sequentially comes after the other, but without literally stating that there's a direct causation between the two.


たら attaches to the reduced verb-sticky form.


私と話しててもつまらないんだったら私帰るわ  

I'll go home if it's boring just talking to me.  

(note: the doubled て comes from ている -> てる -> てて)
Because it doesn't state direct causation, it's very appropriate for questions that depend on something hypothetical.


来たらどうですか How about you come over?
*(Side note: たらどうですか is sometimes treated like its own construction.)*


なら is used when the speaker supposes the first statement is true, and that it implies that the second statement is true. There's basically no restriction on sequence or causation here, only the nature of the truth of the statements. In fact, the second statement can "happen" before the conditional statement does, which other condition constructions can't do.


Normally, なら only attaches to nouns. When you use なら with verbs and い-adjectives, it's normal to attach の as a nominalizer (see Lesson 31). However, putting の between the verb/い-adjective and なら is optional.


Using の can give the nuance that the condition is a instance of the statement, like being sick. Dropping の can give the nuance that the condition is a general thing that might not be true right now, like when it rains.


The meaning of なら does not change because of adding the の. The difference in nuance comes from the verb or い-adjective being nominalized, not の coming before なら. The exact meaning of the statement does not change much.


行くのなら If you're going  

行くなら If you go
Sometimes なら is said as ならば. In fact, ならば is where なら comes from. This ば is the one we already know.


*(To students of grammar: ならば comes from にあり (see also: にてあり/である) -> なり -> ならば. Not from なる (become). なら is the 未然形 of なり. In fact, this is one of the reasons I didn't call the 未然形 form "imperfective": it's a misnomer. And "irrealis" overreaches. "None such" is at worst meaningless.)*




#### Lesson 42: Concurrence with ながら あいだ うちに つつ


ながら states that two events are concurrently true. In the loose sense, they take place concurrently.


The left-hand event before ながら must be secondary to the event after ながら. The distinction is only intuitive, and affects what kinds of uses of ながら are acceptable. This sort of secondariness doesn't necessarily translate into english putting the left-hand event after a "while", it's just a tendency.


ながら attaches to the verb-sticky form of a verb.


読みながら眠ってしまう Ends up falling asleep while reading  

ラテを飲みながら考える Thinks while drinking a latte.
ながら can not be used when the events have different subjects. In that case, あいだ/あいだに is used.


間/あいだ says that two events cover the same span of time. This places constraints on what sorts of statements it accepts. 間 itself acts like a noun.


食べる間、考える Thinking the whole time while eating
間に says that the event after 間に starts and ends within the span of time when the event before 間に is happening.


うちに says that an event happens while the statement before うちに is true, but generally instead of strictly. The statement before うちに is subject to various restrictions.


雨が降らないうちに帰ろう  

Let's return while it's not raining (nuance: before it rains)
つつ, as in XつつY, is a formal-sounding "while" conjunction. Unlike many of the above, it just states that the events are concurrent, not which started when. Like ながら, the subject of both events must be the same.


Because つつ is formal, it is not normal to use it for everyday activities like "I am currently preparing breakfast". You can think of it like it implies that the events are special or occasional.


In general, つつ is an auxiliary conjunction that states that the left-hand event is in progress, and XつつY is just a use of it. In the pattern つつある, it states that the event is progressive, like one of the meanings of ている.




#### Lesson 43: Adversatives with が けど けれど しかし ても and でも


Unrelated to the subject marker が, the conjunction が states that, while the former statement is true, the latter statement is also true. With が, both statements are independent clauses.


そうですが、もう終わりだ That's true, but it's already over.
が attaches to what comes before it like a particle or suffix. が does not attach to the sentence that comes after it like the english "but".


が is sometimes not used as a strict adversity between the two statements, but to connect two related sentences smoothly. Like how I just used "but". Spoken english does the same thing with "but", but sometimes to a confusing degree.


けど is similar to が except the first statement is a subordinate clause. This primarily affects how the syntax works. For example, with が, the two clauses usually have similar levels of formality, but with けど, this is not the case.


高いですけど買おう The price is high but let's buy it.
けど is more weakly bounded than が, so it can be used in confusing ways.


いいけど "It's good, but..." **or** "It's good, though."
けど is the most informal version of けれども. There's also けども and けれど.


しかし is an interjection. It sounds formal.


しかし知らなかった However, I didn't know.
ても is a combination of the て particle/form of a verb and も. It works as a conjunction stating that the statement after it is true despite the statement before it. This is *like* an adversative, but it's not always one.


死んでも死なない I don't die even if I die.
Reality check: you might see い-adjectives take the ても form like なかっても instead of なくても, especially on the internet, but it's abnormal grammar and I can't tell you anything about what the difference implies.


でも is an adversative interjection, or a conjunction that attaches to nouns. This overlaps with a different use of でも that we'll cover soon, so be careful.


でも、そんなことないです But it's not like that.  

無理でも大空に羽ばたけ！ Fly into the sky, even if it's impossible!
だが, だけど, それでも etc are similar interjections made by compounding stuff.




#### Lesson 44: Entailment with から そして ので で


から, not just a case particle, is also a conjunction where the thing after から is "because of" the thing before から. This is called entailment.


いいから止まれ It's fine, so stop.
から is only an interjection in compounds such as だから and ですから. Keep in mind that だから and ですから can occur naturally when から is a conjunction too.


犬だから怖い It's scary because it's a dog.
そして is an interjection that essentially means "therefore". It has a tone similar to "therefore" too, maybe polite rather than formal.


そして起きなかった Therefore he didn't wake up.
ので acts like から. However, ので is allowed in fewer situations than から. ので wants both statements to be real statements, not invitation or conjecture. This narrows down the ways you can interpret the statement in.


実家に帰ったので Because I returned to where I grew up.
ので for nouns is なので, not だので. ので and のだ are related, which is why のだ has the nuance "the reason for something". The more you know.


ので is more "objective" and has less emphasis than other adversatives, which means that it's sometimes used to link two statements that just so happen to have a cause/effect relationship.


で can be used as a conjunction similar to "so". The meaning here is more of a feeling and less of a literal meaning. で is deep in the "academic papers" feeling if it's formal, but it can also be used in rough spoken japanese.


で、おまえは誰だ So just who are you?
This で is the て "particle" of だ. It's the で in the conjunction でも, where も changes it from marking entailment to being adversative.


Words like これ and それ can be combined with conjunctive particles like で (but not limited to で) to narrow down where the entailment is coming from.


それで、ツインテールになる？ You'll become twintails, then?
Things like それから also exist and have their own nuances.




#### Lesson 45: Linking conjunctions のに ように ために せいで だって し


のに is related to ので, but it works in the opposite direction: "even though". Like ので, this is more "objective" than other adversatives. のに also loves being attached to the end of sentences, but remember, it's a conjunction.


ええ～、俺の話なのに Oh? Despite my story?
A second use of のに makes an entire phrase be an adverb, modifying the second phrase. You can remember this use of のに by thinking that it adds の to the first phrase on its own, then adds に, whereas the previous use of のに is a compound. What comes before のに here is always an informal non-past expression. Its most common use is "in order to" as in "in the process of".


黙らせるのには些細な威圧でいい A little "coercion" is fine in silencing people.
The は is not always there.


The two uses of のに can be ambiguous, but context always fills in the gaps.


ように essentially means "so as to", as in "walk so as to keep your back hidden". This walks a fine line between "for the purpose of" and "in such a way as", and ように even has the nuance of walking the line between the two.


離れすぎないように歩く Walking in a way to not separate too much
ように has a second use, but it isn't as bad as のに. The second use here just means "in such a way as X". Note that I didn't write "in such a way that X".


当然のように女物だ It's feminine, as it would be. (liberal translation of 女物)
Be careful not to confuse this with the volitional よう plus に.


ために literally uses the noun ため "purpose" plus に to make a conjunction. The example uses a その, but the purpose can be anything attributive.


そのために仲間を殺せ。 For that purpose kill your comrades.
せい is a noun meaning "fault" used to indicate cause/blame/reason. It usually implies that the effect is undesirable in some way.


私のせいだ！ It's my fault!  

あの鳥が変なことを言うせいだ　It's because that bird is saying weird things.
せい earns its place here because of せいで, which acts like a conjunction meaning "because of". Like ために, せいで doesn't need a statement as its left-hand argument (e.g. 私のせいで), and doesn't express logical entailment.


し is used to link two statements with a feeling of emphasis. Note that this is not the grammar being used in things like 話し (verb) or なし (adjective).
ちゃんとご飯も食べるし、睡眠も取る  

Eating all our meals together and even going to bed together.  

("together" in the translation comes from context not shown in this excerpt)






#### Lesson 46: Aspect with てしまう, ていく, てくる, ておく, ておる


"Aspect" is how a statement interacts with time in ways other than "when the statement happened". Aspect comes into play when you want to say something has "already" happened, or "is fated to" happen, and so on, without adverbs.


Several things we already covered, like ている and てある, are about aspect.


てしまう indicates that something is "complete", "done completely". It's also used when things "end up" in such a "complete" state, like after mistakes. A good way to remember this is to think about "it's done" and "now I've done it".


てしまう can also be ちまう or ちゃう in speech (even voiced, like 死んじゃう). ちゃ～ isn't always てしま～. For example, なくちゃダメ is なくてはダメ.


When ていく doesn't just mean "go and", it means that something is ongoing and will "keep going" at least into the near future. ていく can be spoken as てく.


When てくる doesn't just mean "come and", it means that something was ongoing and has continued into the immediate present, and might go further.


ておく means to do something as a preparation. ておく can be said as とく


ておる is a humble/formal variant of ている. おる and いる have a similar relationship. ておる can be spoken as とる.


Aspectual things happen relative to whatever the "reference" time is. This "reference" time is usually just the tense of statement, but things like narration and quotation mess with how tense and time interact.




#### Lesson 47: The normalization of でも and だって


だって is similar to でも. Review Lesson 24 if needed. The feeling here is to go against something, or quote something, or give something a reason, which basically means it has a general explanatory tone. There's an unspeakable intuition here.


だって、ほんとに可愛いのに But like, even though it really is cute.
Sometimes だって acts like a particle. It means something similar to でも in these situations, though context can make it mean "also".


子供だって出来る Even a kid can do it.
だって is colloquial.
When you attach でも directly to a noun, strange things can happen. This でも has a different nuance than the conjunction.


いぬでもいいです  

Even a dog is fine.
When an interrogative like 何 is buried inside a phrase conjugated to ても, it ends up acting like the above. In fact, this calls back to when we learned about でも turning interrogatives into "any X" words. Polarity is responsible.


何食べても美味しそう Whatever I eat it seems to taste good.  

何でも食べる I eat anything.
Because of polarity, でも as in "even" plays strangely with negatives.


Sometimes, like in volitional or imperative statements, でも can mark something vague that can be substituted. "Even" is a useful part of the intuition here, but it doesn't literally translate well to english. This is the use of でも that you have to be careful about when you consider the "even" meaning.


お茶でも飲みませんか  

Would you like to drink tea or the likes?  

Would you like to drink some tea?
To review the many basic uses of ても/でも:


死んでも死なない I don't die even if I die.  

いぬでもいいです Even a dog is fine.  

何食べても美味しそう Whatever I eat it seems to taste good.  

お茶でも飲みませんか Would you like to drink tea or the likes?
Remember, these are all different and overlap with だって at least a little.








#### Optional Lesson 3: Formal logical conjunctions または, あるいは, 及び, and more


These conjunctions have their own section because they're very easy to learn by exposure when you read. They're basically words of their own. That said, please skip this lesson until you need it. Optional lessons are optional.


Every term in this lesson is usually a written construction, though they can be spoken. Also, the は at the end of a couple of these is the topic marker.


または (又は) separates mutually exclusive options. Normally, it only separates two items, but said items can be lists themselves. Note that または has complex syntax restrictions on what it can attach to.


来るか、または連絡する  

Comes, otherwise communicates  

  

犬、または猫  

A dog **or** a cat
もしくは (若しくは) is another logical conjunction meaning "or". Unlike または, it isn't specifically mutually exclusive. It just presents two alternatives.


死ぬか、もしくは死亡する  

Die, or pass away
あるいは (或いは) is another alternative-presenting conjunction, but this time it has another common use. In addition to acting like "or", it can also act like an interjection that just emphasize the possibility of something.


及び is a logical "and". It doesn't just note that both of the items apply to the statement, it notes that they apply **together**. In this way, it's similar to と (but stricter) when と is used as a logical "and". 及び is formal. Unlike と, 及び can operate on more kinds of objects.


並びに works much like 及び. 並びに can only be used with one set of two items. However, 並びに and 及び can be used together to control the order in which items are combined together.


ものの (物の) has the same general meaning as the conjunction が, but has different restrictions on when it's used. For example, ものの cannot be followed up with a question or a volitional/invitational statement.
