#### Lesson 43: Adversatives with が けど けれど しかし ても and でも


Unrelated to the subject marker が, the conjunction が states that, while the former statement is true, the latter statement is also true. With が, both statements are independent clauses.


> そうですが、もう終わりだ That's true, but it's already over.

が attaches to what comes before it like a particle or suffix. が does not attach to the sentence that comes after it like the english "but".


が is sometimes not used as a strict adversity between the two statements, but to connect two related sentences smoothly. Like how I just used "but". Spoken english does the same thing with "but", but sometimes to a confusing degree.


けど is similar to が except the first statement is a subordinate clause. This primarily affects how the syntax works. For example, with が, the two clauses usually have similar levels of formality, but with けど, this is not the case.


> 高いですけど買おう The price is high but let's buy it.

けど is more weakly bounded than が, so it can be used in confusing ways.


> いいけど "It's good, but..." **or**> "It's good, though."

けど is the most informal version of けれども. There's also けども and けれど.


しかし is an interjection. It sounds formal.


> しかし知らなかった However, I didn't know.

ても is a combination of the て particle/form of a verb and も. It works as a conjunction stating that the statement after it is true despite the statement before it. This is *like* an adversative, but it's not always one.


> 死んでも死なない I don't die even if I die.

Reality check: you might see い-adjectives take the ても form like なかっても instead of なくても, especially on the internet, but it's abnormal grammar and I can't tell you anything about what the difference implies.


でも is an adversative interjection, or a conjunction that attaches to nouns. This overlaps with a different use of でも that we'll cover soon, so be careful.


> でも、そんなことないです But it's not like that.  
> > 無理でも大空に羽ばたけ！ Fly into the sky, even if it's impossible!

だが, だけど, それでも etc are similar interjections made by compounding stuff.
