#### Lesson 13: Questions with か and の, featuring のだ


Questions in japanese are usually formed with tone of voice, or with か, or with の. This covers yes/no questions. We'll cover "wh"-questions later.


When a writer has a character ask a question with just tone of voice, they usually use a ？, but otherwise, the ？ is not needed. Japanese doesn't have the same writing rules as english.


> 熱い？ Is it hot?

When a question is formed with か, the か just goes at the end of the sentence. If the sentence ended with だ (the copula), the だ is removed. There's no special reason for this rule, in fact it can be ignored in archaic writing, it just makes the language simpler.

> お前は警察か Are you with the police?
>
> 熱いか Is it hot?
>
> 知るか？ Do you know?

To frame a question politely, you can use ですか or ますか. ますか is only used with verbs, and it's just the question marker か stuck to a polite verb. ですか attaches to the question you want to ask as a whole, even if it ended with a verb or い-adjective.


>彼は学生ですか。 Is he a student?
>
>古いですか Is it old?
>
>来るですか Is it coming?

食べますか Won't you eat?
Sometimes か forms things that look like rhetorical questions, since they're not really looking for an answer. But they're not actually rhetorical, because they're not trying to make a point. Every language does this.


> あら、そうか。 Oh, is that so.

I'm not saying that か can't be used for rhetorical questions. It can. It's just that this kind of question isn't necessarily rhetorical.


の acts just like か, except that for nouns, you replace だ with な instead of deleting だ. This is the same な from な-adjectives.


> 普通なの Is it normal?
>
> 食べないの？ Won't you eat?
>
> どうしたの What's wrong?

Answering a の-questions usually uses a のだ-statement or a の-statement. This kind of statement can also stand alone, as a kind of non-comprehensive reason or explanation of something. のだ can be pronounced んだ.


> 食べたくないのよ I don't really want to eat. (That's why I'm not eating.)
>
> 遅いんだ I'm late. (I gotta hurry.)
>
> 何してるのだ What are you doing?
>
> 何をしてんだ What're you doing?

のだ isn't used when the speaker is merely making a statement. Also, のだ is sometimes a question, but it's rare, and it's always obvious when it is.
