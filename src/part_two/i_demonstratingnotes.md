#### Intermission: Notes on demonstratives


*Intermissions are optional.*


The "like so" determiners are parallel to よう, but よう isn't part of a demonstrative category. It means just some particular "kind".


There's an irregular demonstrative determiner, かの. かの is used for things that are known to the first and second person, but are distant in a very abstract way. かの is essentially unused outside of very formal or literary uses. Also, the pronoun for "he", かれ, used to be かの's demonstrative pronoun. かの is very literary and you're only likely to encounter it used for literary effect.
