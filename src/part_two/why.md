#### Lesson 14: Why, cruel world? なぜ なんで どうして

なぜ, なんで, and どうして mean "why". They can also be used the same way as "how". "Tone of voice" questions with these words don't need a ？.

Generally, the longer something is, the more polite it is, but in **very** formal situations you can use the short things again. This works here, too. どうして is the most polite, なんで is neutral, and なぜ is the most simple.

> なんで来ません So, why won't he come?
>
> どうして遅いの？ Why is it late?
>
> なぜだろう I wonder why. (not sarcastic)

These words are used in different places by different people in different registers of speech. Sometimes one is more frequent than another in a certain phrase, but there's no real pattern. なぜ can sound rude in conversation.
