Let's relax and do easier stuff before we head out into the real world. Before we start fighting monsters. Before The Gauntlet.



#### Lesson 13: Questions with か and の, featuring のだ


Questions in japanese are usually formed with tone of voice, or with か, or with の. This covers yes/no questions. We'll cover "wh"-questions later.


When a writer has a character ask a question with just tone of voice, they usually use a ？, but otherwise, the ？ is not needed. Japanese doesn't have the same writing rules as english.


熱い？ Is it hot?
When a question is formed with か, the か just goes at the end of the sentence. If the sentence ended with だ (the copula), the だ is removed. There's no special reason for this rule, in fact it can be ignored in archaic writing, it just makes the language simpler.
お前は警察か Are you with the police?  

熱いか Is it hot?  

知るか？ Do you know?
To frame a question politely, you can use ですか or ますか. ますか is only used with verbs, and it's just the question marker か stuck to a polite verb. ですか attaches to the question you want to ask as a whole, even if it ended with a verb or い-adjective.


彼は学生ですか。 Is he a student?  

古いですか Is it old?  

来るですか Is it coming?  

食べますか Won't you eat?
Sometimes か forms things that look like rhetorical questions, since they're not really looking for an answer. But they're not actually rhetorical, because they're not trying to make a point. Every language does this.


あら、そうか。 Oh, is that so.
I'm not saying that か can't be used for rhetorical questions. It can. It's just that this kind of question isn't necessarily rhetorical.


の acts just like か, except that for nouns, you replace だ with な instead of deleting だ. This is the same な from な-adjectives.


普通なの Is it normal?  

食べないの？ Won't you eat?  

どうしたの What's wrong?
Answering a の-questions usually uses a のだ-statement or a の-statement. This kind of statement can also stand alone, as a kind of non-comprehensive reason or explanation of something. のだ can be pronounced んだ.


食べたくないのよ I don't really want to eat. (That's why I'm not eating.)  

遅いんだ I'm late. (I gotta hurry.)  

何してるのだ What are you doing?  

何をしてんだ What're you doing?
のだ isn't used when the speaker is merely making a statement. Also, のだ is sometimes a question, but it's rare, and it's always obvious when it is.








#### Intermission: Two notes on の and のだ


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


When の stands alone at the end of a の-statement, it sounds feminine or cute.


のだ is the etymology of の-statements and の-questions.




#### Lesson 14: Why, cruel world? なぜ なんで どうして


なぜ, なんで, and どうして mean "why". They can also be used the same way as "how". "Tone of voice" questions with these words don't need a ？.


Generally, the longer something is, the more polite it is, but in **very** formal situations you can use the short things again. This works here, too. どうして is the most polite, なんで is neutral, and なぜ is the most simple.


なんで来ません So, why won't he come?  

どうして遅いの？ Why is it late?  

なぜだろう I wonder why. (not sarcastic)
These words are used in different places by different people in different registers of speech. Sometimes one is more frequent than another in a certain phrase, but there's no real pattern. なぜ can sound rude in conversation.




#### Intermission: Notes on なぜ なんで どうして


*Intermissions are optional.*


The なん in なんで corresponds to 何 なに, a word meaning "what".


どうして looks a lot like どうした from an example in the last lesson. That's because it is. どうして is the て "form" of the phrase, and た is the past tense of it.




#### Lesson 15: Getting more with も and と


も is an inclusion marker. You can think of it like "too" or "also" for now.


When も marks something marked by は, が, or を, that particle is dropped.


私も行く I'll go, too (in addition to other people)  

魚も食べたい I want to eat fish too (in addition to something else)  

今日も元気だな You're lively today too, huh. (in addition to another day)
も can be used with negative statements. Normally, it includes the given noun in the set of things that the negative statement is true for. But sometimes it does weird things because negation changes how logical inclusion/exclusion works. We'll cover this in more detail much later, but keep it in mind.


僕も食べない I won't eat, either. (in addition to other people)
と also "includes", but it doesn't "include" on the grammatical level も does.


と normally makes a list of things.


ジムとサトシは来ない Jim and Satoshi won't come.
と sometimes marks a kind of indirect object. Then it acts like "with". This is not the same "with" that で means when it marks "circumstance/means".


私はヤンと勉強しない I don't study with Yan.

*Intermissions are optional.*


The manga よつばと！ stylizes its title as "YOTSUBA&!", with an ampersand.




#### Lesson 16: Existence with いる and ある, finding である and っす


The verbs いる and ある express existence. The difference between the two isn't politeness, it's "animatedness". An animal or person takes いる, but a table or sandwich takes ある. Something like a patrol car, which exists to move but isn't alive, can use one or the other depending on context.


家には猫がいる In the house there lives a cat.  

店がある There are stores.
The above is only a general guideline. Certain uses are interchangeable, but using the wrong existence verb in the wrong phrase will sound unnatural. Picking the unnatural one usually indicates a nuance.


なぜこんなに店がいる Why are there shops like this?
The above is a real phrase that someone wrote, and the choice of いる instead of ある changes the flavor of their frustration. ある would be normal here.


Sometimes, when people want to explain that they have something, they use ある or いる. ある and いる don't mean "have", it's just a wording difference.


デスクがある There's a desk / I have a desk  

私の家には猫がいる I have a cat.
いる conjugates as a one-form verb.


ある conjugates as a five-form verb, but its negative conjugation is irregular.


ある ない あった あります ありません  

  

店がない There is no store.
Now that we know ある, we can bring up the etymology of だ, which is である. である is a very formal "to be" word derived from にてあり. Unlike だ and です, である can be used with relative clauses attached to nouns.


You might remember that we used ではない to derive the negative of だ, じゃない. ではない is basically である's negative.


である　であった　ではない
*(Warning: であった is identical to 出会った written in kana, another verb's past tense.)*


Usually, the topic particle は is inserted between で and ない here. However, you **do** sometimes run into でない, especially in entertainment media.


Finally, we come to っす, a slurred version of です used in casual speech. It's less formal than です, but serves the same grammatical roles. There's a stereotype of it being used by girls and young women.


いいです -> いいっす  

犬ですか -> 犬っすか
っす is also sometimes used to contract ございます, a keigo version of ある. Again, removing the formality from it, but keeping the politeness.


おはようございます -> おはようっす -> おっす (yes, really)


#### Intermission: Notes on いる, ある, である, and っす


*Intermissions are optional.*


要る いる "need" is a different word than いる "exist" and conjugates differently.


ある used to have "real" negative forms (あらず, あらぬ), but they have been entirely replaced with ない. This is the same process that gave us go -> went in english.


Note that some dialects of japanese sometimes use あらへん as a negative of ある, and you will definitely run into あらへん in entertainment media. へん can substitute for ない in general in these dialects.


ある's imperative is あれ, but it's not really used that often, and it conflicts with an unrelated word we haven't introduced yet.


である is appropriate for ceremonies, archaic things, and pretentious things. If someone starts rolling off tons of である, they're not being formal, they're being histrionic. であります is even better.


The etymology of です itself is not known, but the two leading ideas (at the time of writing) are that it's a contraction of でございます or であります.




#### Lesson 17: Enduring the pain of ている and てある


This brings us to ている and てある, which use いる/ある as auxiliary verbs.
ている indicates an enduring action/state. For most verbs, this means progressive or continuous (enduring action), but for others, it means the complete state of the action remains (enduring state). The second kind of verb is usually "intransitive", meaning that they cannot normally accept a direct object, like 死ぬ "die".


食べている I'm eating. (enduring action)  

死んでいる He's dead. (enduring state)
The い in ている can be dropped. This is normal but not formal.


食べてる I'm eating.
てある is about something being in an enduring state resulting from an action. It's important to remember that てある expresses a state, not an action.


ケーキ作ってあるよ The cake's done! (Someone has made the cake.)
てある takes the direct object and treats it as a subject. This means that the verb's normal "logical object" is usually marked with が or は or unmarked, like the cake in the example above. But because japanese is linguistically weird, sometimes を is used, too. You can think of using を here like taking the entire phrase "<thing>を作る" and conjugating that phrase with てある.


Finally, it expresses a state, not an action, so てある is not "the passive". Japanese has a real passive that we'll cover soon.


Normally, intransitive verbs plus ている act alike transitive verbs plus てある, aside from using the logical subject instead of the logical object. This is what "enduring state" means for ている.


ている only shows up for い-adjectives when the い-adjective is the end of a verb phrase, like 食べないでいる. This is the て "form" of the verb phrase 食べない. You can't do this with い-adjectives on their own.


Something like なくている is nonsensical because the くて form of い-adjectives is always a conjunction, never a way to string words together. Remember not to confuse the words "conjugation" and "conjunction".








#### Intermission: Notes on ている and てある


*Intermissions are optional.*


Progressive ている can also be something that happens on a regular basis, not just at the moment. Like "I go to a highschool".


を with てある is the first of many brainfucky constructions that really mess with western conceptions of subject, object, etc. No grammar instruction will help you understand more than if you did a little reading. Read, read, and read more.


The closest thing to てある for い-adjectives is くある, which is only used in constructions that want to work on the adjective like a verb like 悪くあります, and is wrong or unnatural on its own like in 悪くある. A couple adverb-based constructions like 多くある overlap with this くある, but they're different. You will definitely run into things like 悪くあります, but this is a way of making polite verbal statements with adjectives, not expressing an enduring state.




#### Lesson 18: Demonstrating: これ, それ, あれ, どれ, and friends


These words are called demonstratives. Demonstratives are words that mean things like "this", "that", etc.


Japanese is different than english on this front in two ways. First, its demonstratives are much more regular, and second, it has demonstratives point at three "locations" instead of two.


これ this thing  

それ that thing (near you　/ over there)  

あれ that thing (over there / over yonder) (distant)  

どれ which thing

コレはいいですか Is this good?
The above four words are "demonstrative pronouns". There's two pronouns that translate into english as "that", but they reference different places. それ is for things that are near the "second person" instead of just away from the "first person". あれ is for things that aren't close to either person.


Again, aside from "that" being split into two categories, they're very similar to english. Physical distance is just a useful reference about how they're different, not a deciding factor about how they're used.


The demonstrative "determiners" just use good old の. A determiner *determines* a particular thing or group of things.


この this X  

その that X  

あの that X (distant)  

どの which X  

  

このバカが...! This idiot...!
There are also "sorts", locations, etc. The あ series is a little irregular, but the か and さ series are regular.


ここ here (this place)  

こちら/こっち this way (towards here)  

こんな this sort of X  

こう like this  

そう like that  

あそこ over there (distant)  

ああ like that (distant)
There are a couple demonstrative personal pronouns as well, but the meanings of the most common ones look a little irregular. These are the common ones.


こいつ this guy  

そいつ that guy  

あいつ that guy (distant)  

あなた you (yep, this is a demonstrative)
Literal physical distance is not the determining factor for which personal pronoun is used in a given situation, common use is.


どいつ exists but it's mostly only used in grammatical constructions.




#### Intermission: Notes on demonstratives


*Intermissions are optional.*


The "like so" determiners are parallel to よう, but よう isn't part of a demonstrative category. It means just some particular "kind".


There's an irregular demonstrative determiner, かの. かの is used for things that are known to the first and second person, but are distant in a very abstract way. かの is essentially unused outside of very formal or literary uses. Also, the pronoun for "he", かれ, used to be かの's demonstrative pronoun. かの is very literary and you're only likely to encounter it used for literary effect.
