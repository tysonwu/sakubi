#### Lesson 35: More questions with っけ/け, かい, じゃない, and じゃん


っけ/け is used to ask positive "confirmation" questions, as well as questions about something the speaker forgot about.

> なんだっけ？ "What was it again?"
>
> どこに置いたっけ "Oh, where'd I put it?"

っけ/け is almost never used with non-nouns except in the past tense. When it is, other stuff is usually put in between.


> 来るんだっけ

In kansai and some other dialects け is a rough-sounding alternative か.


かい is a "friendly" question marker, especially for masculine speakers. Outside of familiar conversation, it's usually rude. It's か + い, and this い can show up attached to other stuff as well, like だ.


> お元気かい？ You doin' well?

じゃない is used to ask confirmation questions. Yes, when attached to nouns, it's identical to normal "is not". No, there's no way around it.


> いいじゃない It's fine, isn't it?

じゃん is a contraction of じゃない, but only used for confirmation questions.
