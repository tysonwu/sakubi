### Part 5: Getting a point across


What can you do? A sword isn't enough to solve all the problems you run into. That bridge troll isn't taking money and food out of malice. He keeps the bridge from collapsing. You've gotta communicate so he knows why you can't pay.


*(By the way, starting now, some examples won't have translations.)*



#### Lesson 32: Just with だけ, のみ, ただ, ばかり, しか


だけ, のみ, ただ, and ばかり are variations of "just" or "only". しか is similar, but it has negative polarity.


だけ means "just so", in terms of amount. It acts like a particle.


俺だけ行く I'm the only one going (Metaphorically: "Only I will go")  

俺だけじゃないよ "It's not just me though."
のみ is like a less colloquial だけ that shows up in different grammar patterns.


ただの人間が存在するのみです There are only mere humans.
ただ is related to the idea of "just so", but it focuses on emphasis. Except for specific constructions (like ただの), taking a true sentence and adding ただ will result in another true sentence; this is not true of だけ or のみ.


僕はただ子供だよ I'm just a kid.
One construction where ただ is not just about emphasis is ただ一つ, where 一つ


ただ一つ問題がある There's just one problem.
たった is basically a variant of ただ.


ばかり is yet another "only" word. Like だけ and のみ, it changes what the sentence means. It can also be pronounced ばっか or ばっかり. ばかり focuses on *everything falling into this statement*, whereas だけ and のみ focus on *things falling outside of this statement being false*. ばかり is sometimes translated like "He always X" or "The only thing left to do now is X". ばかり cannot be used in negative environments.


犬ばかりだ It's nothing but dogs.
ばかり can also mean "just" in the time sense, usually with the past tense.


ばかり来たよ
しか is used with negative statements to say that the negative statement is true of everything except for what is tagged with しか, like "but".


僕しかいない Nobody but me is here.
Be careful, though, because しか can occur in grammar fossils like いつしか where it isn't a "but/except" word at all.
彼はいつしか行ってしまった He ended up leaving before anyone noticed.
Sometimes (but rarely), しか is used outside of complete statements.


「みんな来たの？」 「うん、彼しか」 "Did everyone come?" "Yeah, except him."
*Warning: the above example is completely contrived.*


The difference between しか and だけ in negatively-polarized statements is basically the reason that polarity exists.
僕しかいない Except for me, people are not here. (I'm the only one here.)  

僕だけいない Just me, I am not here. (I'm the only one not here.)
しか can be substituted with っきゃ.












#### Lesson 33: Still, already, and yet with もう まだ また


With positive statements, もう expresses "already". With negative statements, it works together with the negation to express "not anymore".


Basically, もう means that there's a change of state from the statement being false or irrelevant to the statement being true: "already" and "not anymore".


もうそんな時間ね That kind of time already, huh?  

もう食べた I already ate.  

もう食べない I won't eat anymore.  

もういいよ Metaphorically: "It's good already."  

もう！ Metaphorically: "Enough!"
In statements about the near future, もう can mean "soon" instead. This usually goes along with an adverb expressing soonness, but sometimes it's just implied.


Another use of もう expresses "more" of an amount. This has a different accent but it's usually considered the same word.


もう一回！ One more time!  

もうちょっと A bit more
まだ expresses the idea of "still" or "yet" as in the opposite of もう. It's used when a state stays the same.


まだ来た  

まだ食べるの？ You still eating?  

まだ負けないな！ I'm not beaten yet!  

まだまだ "Not yet!"
もう is used for "yet" in positive questions, since もう concerns a change, and まだ concerns staying the same. もう can still mean "already" in questions, though.


もう書きましたか？ Did you write it yet?  

もう眠いの？ Are you already sleepy?
また expresses the idea of "again". Try not to confuse this with まだ.


また来た He came again.  

また来ないな Looks like he's not coming, again.  

また来なかった Didn't come again.
The last three examples are slightly ambiguous, both in japanese and english.




#### Lesson 34: Not wanting with まい and permission with いい, ますか/ませんか


"Negative volition" means basically "determined not to X". There are several ways to express this in japanese. Most of them are phrased literally and you can figure them out with a dictionary, but まい deserves direct explanation.


まい is kind of a modern writing thing. Being modern means it shows in speech.


まい normally acts like some kind of auxiliary noun. However, for one-form verbs, it can also act as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the inherent base.


行くまい  

食べるまい  

食べまい  

来るまい  

するまい
For する and くる, you sometimes see すまい and こまい. しまい also happens.


まいとする expresses "try not to do X".


食べまいとする Trying not to eat
Negative volition can also invite ideas, just like positive volition (compare だろう, でしょう, etc). This is one of the more common uses of まい in speech.


そんなわけでもあるまい Such a thing is out of the question.
いい just means "good" or "fine" and isn't a grammatical term in itself, but it's used directly in patterns about permission.


食べていい？  

いいよ
When people use よかった they're normally expressing gladness, not goodness. よかった shouldn't be used for permission.


When negation is involved, "permission" statements with いい often walk the line between permission and request, just like excessively polite english. The くて form of い-adjectives can be used here, but acts like an entity, not as a linker, like how it's an entity in なくては.
食べないでいいよ (fine not to eat)  

食べなくていいよ (fine if you don't eat)
Sometimes, ますか and ませんか are a way of inviting permission politely, rather than asking a negative question. Think of this the same way as how ていい is used for permission even though it doesn't say "permission" anywhere.


食べますか Won't you eat?  

舐めてませんか？　ねえ？ Won't you try it? How about it?  

お仕事お休みできませんか……？ Is it impossible to take the day off...?






#### Lesson 35: More questions with っけ/け, かい, じゃない, and じゃん


っけ/け is used to ask positive "confirmation" questions, as well as questions about something the speaker forgot about.
なんだっけ？ "What was it again?"  

どこに置いたっけ "Oh, where'd I put it?"
っけ/け is almost never used with non-nouns except in the past tense. When it is, other stuff is usually put in between.


来るんだっけ
In kansai and some other dialects け is a rough-sounding alternative か.


かい is a "friendly" question marker, especially for masculine speakers. Outside of familiar conversation, it's usually rude. It's か + い, and this い can show up attached to other stuff as well, like だ.


お元気かい？ You doin' well?
じゃない is used to ask confirmation questions. Yes, when attached to nouns, it's identical to normal "is not". No, there's no way around it.


いいじゃない It's fine, isn't it?
じゃん is a contraction of じゃない, but only used for confirmation questions.








#### Lesson 36: Making lists with や and とか and と and か


While english makes lists by separating words separated by pauses, with the nature of the list indicated by filler words or conjunctions ("like", "and", "or the likes", etc), japanese usually tags each item individually, with the tag expressing the nature of the list.


Tagging items individually is grammatically simpler in japanese. The final instance of an individual tag is usually dropped with the simpler tags.


や makes a non-exhaustive list, and doesn't strictly require each item, but the idea of them as a class of things is maintained.


スプーンやフォークで食べること To eat with spoons or forks (or the likes).
と was covered as a side-note before, but here we'll cover it explicitly and compare it to や. と makes a "generic" list. It's not necessarily exhaustive, but still counts each item individually.


リンゴと魚とタイヤキを食べた Ate taiyaki, fish, and apples.
とか makes a "vague" list. It's vague, and therefore non-exhaustive, but each item is its own; the items aren't treated as a class of things. 


スプーンとかフォークで食べること To eat with a spoon or fork (or something).
か can be used in a similar way, but lists alternatives.


In fact, とか is the combination of と and か, both as listing particles. と makes a generic list of individual things, か makes a list of alternatives, and とか makes a general list of individual alternatives.


The above explanations are not literal. Japanese people don't think "I'm going to make a class of things and use や to list examples of it". Because the markers don't have 1:1 matches in english, the explanation has to be abstract. Please remember that japanese is just another language, and native speakers go through similar mental processes to what you do in your own native language.




#### Lesson 37: Getting self-conscious with より and counting with つ


より is used to compare two things in a direct way, like the "than" in "I'm smarter than you". When you use より, you do not need to use a "more" word, unlike how english needs to say "more X than Y" or "Xer than Y".


彼は誰よりも強いよ  

He's stronger than anyone, dude.
より is also used in constructions about relative position (in space or time), and acts like "from" or "compared to" rather than "than" in these situations.


東京より北 North of Tokyo  

新世界より From the New World
When you want to qualify an object as having a specific number/count, you don't just glue the number together with the object like you do in english ("five men"). In japanese, only "counter words" can accept numbers directly. This serves a similar role to english phrases like "four heads of cow".
The most common counter word is つ.


一つ　ひとつ  

二つ　ふたり  

三つ　みっつ  

四つ　よっつ  

五つ　いつつ  

六つ　むっつ  

七つ　ななつ  

八つ　やっつ  

九つ　ここのつ  

十　　とお (not a counter)
The above numbers come from the native japonic number system. Japanese has a second number system which it adopted from china, which begins with "ichi, ni, san ...", etc. Both systems are used everywhere, but aren't interchangeable. Some counters use only japonic numbers, some use only the numbers from china, and some use a specific mix of both, differing for different values.


Here's an example of counters in use:


もう一つ質問 Still one question  

たった１つの風呂 Just one bath  

でも１つ間違ってるぞ But you got one thing wrong!
In japanese, "countable words" are a closed set, made up entirely of these counters. In english, almost every word is countable. For example, "money" is an uncountable word. You can't say "I have a hundred money".


*(To students of grammar: つ was a genitive marker in very olden times)*








#### Lesson 38: なる and でできる, bonus causative せる, and reviewing the passive


Japanese has phrasal verbs, just like english. Phrasal verbs are basically verb-based phrases that have their own definitions, like "turn into".
なる is a verb meaning something like "become" or "ending up being". In addition to just "become", it can be used for all sorts of indirect states, like a team ending up being its members, or a rumor turning out to be true.


俺、ツインテールになります I will become twintails.
Despite being described as になる, it actually takes an adverb as the argument of なる, not just nouns marked with に. に basically acts as an adverbial marker for nouns. The phrase we're looking at here is <adverb>なる, not になる. There are even phrases with the string になる that aren't necessarily <adverb>なる, like のためになる.


The く form of い-adjectives is adverbial. Compare くなる to くない:


強くなれば If I become strong  

強くなければ If I am not strong
Note that ければ on i-adjectives can be spoken as けりゃ or きゃ: 強くなきゃ.


When になります is being used in the particular type of polite speech used by service job workers, it has a nuance based on になる, but doesn't literally mean the same thing. Blame keigo.


出来る できる is a verb about being "made", complete, or even "made out of". It **also** replaces the missing potential form of する.


The phrase でできる means "be made out of":


この体は、無限の剣で出来ていた。  

This body was made out of infinite swords.
でできる usually, but not always, takes the form でできている when used like this. Also, できる doesn't **require** the で before it for it to talk about being made out of something, just like なる and becoming.


せる is a "causative" verb form. It means the action of making or letting someone do something. Yes, it's used for both, and that's why it has a vague name like causative.


For five-form verbs, せる attaches to the "none such" form. For one-form verbs, さ is inserted between せる and the verb's *one and only base*.


終わらせる・死なせる・食べさせる To make/let someone/something end/die/eat
Causation is the logical opposite of a passive. The relationship between the subject and verb changes in the opposite direction. When you use the passive and causative together, your subject is the one doing the core action again, but because of the causative and passive, the meaning is no longer the same.


書かせる To make \_\_\_ write (not the one doing the writing)  

書かれる To be written (not the one doing the writing)  

書かせられる To be made to write (the one doing the writing)
Reality check: a short form of the causative verb exists in the spoken language, and isn't considered wrong there. Replace せる with す. Supposedly, this doesn't apply to one-form verbs or す verbs, but don't hold your breath.


書かす
Causative-passive still applies, as if the す were a five-form verb ending.


書かされる






#### Lesson 39: Reflexes with 自分


In english, you don't say "Jim broke Jim's watch" when there's just one Jim. You say "Jim broke his watch", or sometimes "Jim broke his own watch". You don't say "Jim hurt Jim", or "Jim hurt him", you say "Jim hurt himself".


"His own" and "himself" have the property of being "reflexive". You already know how it works, "reflexive" is just the jargon used for it. When you need to do something reflexive in japanese, 自分 fulfills this behavior.


自分の体を食べた It eats its own flesh  

自分で遊ぶ Plays by himself  

お前、自分で… You, on your own...
自分 is also used in some dialects (and systems of slang) as a general personal pronoun, usually for the first person, but sometimes the second. It can be used like that in normal speech too, since it's a vague way to talk about someone.




#### Optional Lesson 2: Bonus auxiliaries: 見る, とする, と思う, と決める


Many ordinary verbs have additional uses as "auxiliary" verbs, verbs attached to the end of the verb-sticky form or て form of another verb. Instead of meaning what they normally mean, they're used to express things that japanese doesn't have dedicated verbal conjugations for.


Most of these are very easy to pick up from reading, except for how complicated とする is. とする has enough to say about it that I consider it advanced grammar, which is the only reason it's buried away in this optional lesson rather than being put in the later course lesson on "aspect".


見る, in the construction てみる, as in 食べてみる, indicates that the action is "tried", or being done "to see what happens". This can overlap with the normal meaning of みる, but not always.


読んで見る I'll read it and see (what it's like).  

食べてみる I'll try to eat it.
In the next three auxiliaries, the と is the embedded clause marker. This might help you understand how that use of と works.


とする has three main uses. The first means that someone supposes/assumes something, used with statements. Think of it like "pretend that/act as though". This is easiest to see as an invitation, but can be part of a longer sentence about someone else's presumptions too.


それが犬だとする Let's say that's the dog.  

来たとする Assume it came.
The second is として, with a general vague "operating as X" meaning. This is directly related to the first use, think of it like "thinking of Y as an X", but it doesn't work the same way psychologically.


研究者として As a researcher
The third use means that something undergoes an "experiential" state, basically used with "mimetic" words like つるつる "slick".


つるっとする It goes "slurp"
と思う has two main uses.


Normally, と思う means that the **speaker** thinks something.


来たと思った I thought that it came.
When と思う is used with a volitional phrase, it can mean the speaker thinks that they should do something.


食べようと思う I think I should eat.
When the speaker wants to talk about someone else supposing that they should do something, they have to use the ている form of と思う.


彼は勉強しようと思っている He thinks he might as well study.
