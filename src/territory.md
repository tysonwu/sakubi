SECTION TWO: ABSOLUTE TERRITORY
-------------------------------


At this point, you should begin reading, skimming later lessons to see what the guide has to say about the unfamiliar grammar you encounter. The remainder of this guide is half guidance, half reference. Because it's half reference, I'm going to use jargon more often. Be ready for it.


Language learning takes time, even if you put in a lot of effort. You have to apply yourself, but you won't see big results until you do it for a long enough time. Think about what that means. The very first time you start reading, everything is going to feel really weird and you're not going to "get it". That's okay. It'd be weird if you *didn't* react that way. But reading (or using other forms of input) is the only way to make that weird feeling go away.


And this goes for every little part of reading, with new words, grammar patterns, ways that japanese people communicate, and figures of speech all feeling weird and alien at first and not making sense until you're exposed to them enough, even if you study them a lot without really using what you've started learning. That's why you've gotta start reading. You have to start the process of making your brain familiar with it in the ways that we don't understand yet.


Here's another way to think about it. Let me take a moment to preach. This guide can't teach you japanese. Nobody can teach you japanese. The only way to learn japanese is to understand messages that are written or said in japanese. Why is the focus on "understanding messages" in particular? Two reasons:


One: If something is way out of your depth, you won't learn anything from it. If you don't understand what's being said, you won't learn anything new about the vocabulary and grammar used in it.


Two: It's totally possible to consume something and understand its individual parts but have no idea what it "means". You can break 食べてきました down into its individual parts, and that helps you see the syntax, but unless you understand **what** it's saying, not just **how** it's said, you won't acquire anything from the message. Understanding the content or meaning of the message itself is a precondition to learning from it.


A lot of people start learning a language and focus a lot on picking apart messages one word or phrase at a time, like it's a puzzle. This can make things seem less confusing, but if you insist on doing it all the time, you'll miss the big picture and fail to comprehend a lot of messages.


This is made worse when you think that your grammar guide teaches you everything nonliteral that you need to know. In reality, guides can't teach you all the high level stuff unless you're some kind of linguistics savant. Even if you know everything your guide explicitly teaches you, the guide will always leave out important background information about *why* things work how they do, things that would make other basic grammar way easier to understand.


Once you figure out "Huh, 食べてきました seems to be used in <situation X> a lot", that's when it's time to break it down and try to see what individual parts contribute, comparing them to similar phrases you already know. If you always start with the individual parts, you'll miss the general idea, and fail to associate the phrase with the situation.


That association is what lets your brain acquire the phrase and get a fluent handle on it. Noticing what things mean when they're used is **the thing** that you need to do if you want to learn japanese. No textbook, not even the best one, and no grammar guide, not even this one, can give you that. It's all up to you.


Don't think. Feel.

### Part 4: Communicating


No matter how stubborn the questgiver, rat tails will solve anything. RPG cliches tell us so. Even heroes need to make conversation. At least understand.



#### Lesson 24: "Quoting" with って and と and という/っていう/つう taking note of だって


There are two basic types of relative clause. The first is the kind that modifies a noun, which we already learned about. The second is the embedded clause, which uses a clause without attaching it to a noun, like the second half of "He said that the war would end soon".


って and と, which act like "quotation" markers, mark embedded clauses.


いいと思う I think it's fine.  

元気と言った He said he felt fine.  

見えると聞いた I heard that it's visible.
There are restrictions on the forms that verbs are allowed to take at the end of an embedded clause, except for actual literal quotations. Japanese lets grammar leak between outer and inner clauses in different ways than english does.


って is essentially a colloquial version of と.


駄目って言った She said it was no good.  

何だって？ What did you say?
って can also be an emphasizing particle, or just isolate information.


猫って嫌い！ I **hate** cats!  

日本語難しいって "Japanese is hard".
Now we're going to tackle という/ていう/つう, a construction that uses と/って.


The expression と言う という is used to construct a relative clause in ways that would be awkward otherwise. Not all instances of という are this expression, but normally, if it's written in just hiragana, it's the expression.


研究者という人間 The people that are researchers  

休みたいという訳で Because I want to take a break
It can also just be used for emphasis.


今日という日 The day that is today
っていう is basically という but with って. つう is a contraction of it.


だって is a conjunction or particle (depending on who you ask) made from compounding だ and って, and has the nuance of a rebuttal. This doesn't work the same way as adding って to a clause that already ends in だ, which is also possible.


俺だって負けられない！  

Even if it's me, I can't lose!  

  

だって、今日は祭り  

I mean, today's the festival.
This is only one of the uses of だって. We'll cover the other uses later.




#### Lesson 25: Adverbs with と-adverbs, に-adverbs, and い-adjectives even


Adverbs are words that modify the nature of an event. In english, the "liberally" in "Please add sugar liberally" is an adverb. In japanese, adverbs don't inflect like adjectives and verbs do, though you can inflect them before turning them into adverbs.


Japanese has "true" adverbs that can be used with no special marking at all, in addition to other kinds of adverbs.


全く光のない Entirely without light  

全然駄目だ It's no use at all
と-adverbs are words that take と when used as an adverb.


自然と殺す Kill naturally/spontaneously/by nature  

次々と出てきます They're coming out one after the other.
に-adverbs are words that take に when used as an adverb. In fact, except for a few fixed phrases, almost all に-adverbs are nouns of some sort, usually な-adjectives. This is where に turns into an adverbial marker for nouns. A bunch of expressions that are considered grammar features are just nouns with relative clauses on the left side and an adverbial に on the right side.


自由に研究する Study freely  

特別にいいです It's particularly good
い-adjectives can be used as adverbs by replacing the い with a く.
早く起きる Get up early
Adverbs sometimes take する to construct an action about the adverb. This is similar to how the negative form of い-adjectives (e.g. 赤くない) puts く before ない.


広々としている It's spacious.  

確りして Hang in there / Stay frosty / Get a hold of yourself
*(To students of grammar: the use of に as an "adverbial" marker for nouns might have a different etymology than the use of に as an oblique case marker. It might correspond to the defective Old Japanese copula n- \*ni/no2/nite.)*








#### Lesson 26: Sentence ending particles with ね, な, よ, ぜ, ぞ, わ, さ


These are particles that go at the end of statements to show how the speaker feels. The descriptions below are not literal. That is, the given explanation isn't the reason a speaker would actually use the particle. They're just a way to represent the underlying tone. You gotta acquire them yourself.


ね feels as though the speaker wants the listener to agree. When ね comes at the beginning of a sentence, it serves to get attention.


いい天気だね It's good weather, ey?  

ね、来るの？ Hey, are you coming?
な indicates emphasis. Note that there's a different sentence-ender that can conflict with this one, and in such places, this one is usually written with the vowel elongated somehow, and the other normally.


いいなぁ That's good, huh.
よ feels as though the speaker expects other people to know what the speaker knows, or that the speaker wants to share their care.


いいよ It's fine.  

彼が犬だよ He's a dog! (not surprised)
ぞ indicates assertion, but it's not necessarily impolite. It feels slightly non-feminine.


誰もいないぞ Nobody's here, man.  

行くぞ！ A'ight, let's head out! (speaking about himself, to himself)
ぜ is like ぞ but feels more lighthearted. In fact, it can turn otherwise assertive statements into suggestions.


いいだぜ！ It's nice!
Note that adding ぜ to だ makes だぜ act like a compound sentence ending particle, which is the only reason だ is allowed to attach to いい here. This can happen when using other particles with だ, too, not just ぜ.


わ is an exclamation. It usually feels as though the speaker is confident in what they're saying, but not forceful. In stories, it's usually feminine, but sometimes it acts like a "gender enhancer" instead, even for dudeish soldiers.


元気ですわよ！ I'm feeling good!
さ tries to induce optimism, or it hopes the listener will take it easy. さ can also introduce a sentence, just like ね.


犬がいないさ There's no dogs here, see?  

早く起きなくてさ I didn't get up early, and, well.  

さぁ、見てみる Well, let's see.
Finally, looking back at だぜ, we can finally say that the reason です is allowed to attach to い-adjectives is because です itself acts like a sentence-ending particle.
*(To students of grammar: these are "modal particles".)*








#### Lesson 27: Asking kindly with なさい, ください; prohibition with な


なさい asks someone to do something as a matter of course. It feels as though the asker expects the listener to do the action, but it's still a kind request.


聞きなさい Please listen.  

食べなさい Please eat.
ください asks someone to do something for you, or for your benefit. It comes from 下る くだる a verb basically meaning "give", and it's sometimes spelled with 下 even when actual giving is not what's going on.


死んでください Please die.  

アイスください Ice cream, please.
ください can be used with negative verbs, but when it is, the form is made with ないで instead of なくて. This is the same as how you can't say なくている. In situations like this, ないで acts like the て "form" of ない, and なくて doesn't.


死なないでください！ Please don't die!
Finally, we get to using な to indicate prohibition, which attaches to the end of a statement, one without ます and without the past tense. This is the sentence-ender that overlaps with the version of な that does emphasis.


来るな！ Stay away! (Don't come!)
Reality check: なさい can be abbreviated to just な. This is never in conflict with な as in emphasis or prohibition, because it always attaches to the verb-sticky form, not to a statement.


聞きな Listen up.


#### Lesson 28: Question nouns: なに, だれ, どれ, いつ


These are called interrogatives. They're used in order to ask wh-questions. These words can't be used as relative clause markers like english does in "The person who was fine with it". They also show up as parts of larger grammatical words.
何 なに "what"


何するの？  

Whatcha doin'?
誰 だれ "who"


誰だ！  

Who's there!  

  

誰？  

Who?  

  

誰ですか  

Who is it?
どれ basically "which"


どれがいいかなぁ  

I wonder which one would be good.
いつ "when" (not "while" or "at the time that")


いつがいいか  

When's good?  

  

いつから君がいた、ここ？  

How long have you been here?  

(metaphorically, "Since when were you here?")
Japanese is a "wh-in-situ" language, which just means that it doesn't need to move interrogatives around in wh-questions like english does.








#### Lesson 29: か and も as modifying question nouns (note なんと なんて なんか)


When か isn't marking a question, it can turn interrogatives into generic nouns.


なにか something  

だれか someone  

どれか "somewhich" (metaphorically; as in one of the options)  

いつか sometime (sometimes "in due time"/"eventually", like in english)  

  

なにかあった？ Did something happen? (NOT "what happened?")
When も isn't marking grammatical inclusion, it can turn interrogatives into "in/exclusive" nouns. This is more complicated, and aside from だれも they can only be used with negatively "oriented" phrases. (\* orientedness: see footnote)


なにも anything/nothing  

だれも everyone/anyone/noone  

どれも any of them/none of them  

いつも anytime/never  

  

誰もいないか？
どれか and どれも are noticeably less common than the others due to the logical nature of どれ.


The fact that だれも can be used for "everyone" in positive statements is irregular, and every other interrogative has its own irregular "every X", but I can't be bothered to cover them.


There's an obvious logical distinction between "every particular thing" and "any one particular thing". By attaching でも, you give it "any" in the sense of "any one particular thing", and it can be used with positive statements.


私が誰でも助ける I'll save anyone.
With that out of the way, let's look at なんか, which comes from なにか. In practice, なんか is one of the most common filler words in japanese, and is frequently used in places where translations should use "sorta", "like", etc. なんか can still mean "something", but this filler use is too important to ignore.


なんか変！ That's like, weird!
On the topic of なに-based grammatical terms, なんて is frequently used to express belittlement or scorn. なんて isn't always negative, it's a matter of nuance. なんと is used the same way but does not have the negative nuance.


なんて優しい。 How sweet.  

なんと優しい。 How kind. (not sarcastic)
*For more information on negative "orientation", which has to do with how logical inclusion/exclusion works outside of simple statements, see Optional Lesson 1 on "Polarity". All languages do this.*




#### Lesson 30: Saying yes and no with うん, ううん, はい, いいえ, ええ, and いや


The exact situations where different yes/no words are used are pretty much entirely dependent on convention. As such, the rules are too complicated to teach. But I can give a rundown of the common yes/no words anyway.


うん - Yep (casual)  

ううん - Nope (casual)
うん and ううん have completely different tones of voice when spoken.


はい - Yes (general use)  

いいえ - No (polite)  

  

ええ - Yeah (informal, kind)  

いや - No (rough)
Warning: ええ can be an unrelated filler word that feels like the speaker has something to elaborate on or deny, or that they're confused.


In addition to "no", 嫌 いや is also a な-adjective used for unlikeable things.


嫌だ! いやだ！ No!  

嫌なことしないでください Please don't do something bad.
いや can also be said as や. This usually isn't done if it'd be confusing.




#### Lesson 31: Generic nouns and nominalization with 事, 物, ところ, and の


事 こと and 物 もの both mean "thing". 事 is generally used for intangibles like actions or states, and 物 is generally used for tangibles like objects.


私のこと知らないの？ D'ya not know about me?  

可愛いもの好き I like cute things.
所 ところ is a word that means "place", and is used in similar patterns, including ones about intangible places like places in time or progress, and facets/aspects of an entity. Singling out an abstract point in time is extremely flexible, and can imply things like completion, change in state, etc.


彼女は珍しいところもある There's some unusual points to her, too.  

同情したところで、過去はもう―― Even if I had felt the same, the past is already... ("By the point I felt the same, ...")
All three of these generic nouns can turn entire phrases into nouns. This lets japanese use phrases like things without using embedded clauses. This is basically a special simplified case of the relative clauses we learned about in lesson 11.


そんなもののために死ぬことはない  

There's no dying for such a thing.  

(Metaphorically, "There is not to die for the purpose of such a thing")  

  

このところ夜は  

Recent nights  

  

事件なんかあったものね  

Well, some kind of incident happened.
Both of these uses extend to の for some reason.


赤いのはいいよ  

The red one is fine.  

  

いつ使用するのがいいですか  

When should I use it?  

(Metaphorically, "When is using good?")
This use of の is the reason の is used in のだ.


#### Optional Lesson 1: Polarity


*This is a very hard lesson. This lesson is completely optional.*


This topic is very hard to explain because it's so intuitive, and happens at a level so far away from language itself.


Because this optional lesson is so hard, you might want to try learning polarity in an easier way instead. Try watching [this video from The Ling Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8cjyxHQdw) first. It might be all you need.



Video link: [Why Can't "Any" Go Just Anywhere? NPIs; The Ling Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8cjyxHQdw)


First of all, it's important to note that polarity isn't a grammatical category or a type of word, like "tense" or "verb" are. Instead, polarity is something that the human mind does, that it enforces on language, and in the process, makes complicated logical constructions less contextual.


Because it's almost entirely subconscious, you don't notice it, so when polarity is explained in an abstract way, it's confusing. But polarity is an easy grammatical process. It's just hard to talk about because it operates, basically, at a level before words.


The simplest form of polarity is when words can only be used with negative phrases. "Rejecting" positive phrases is basically why it's called polarity.

"I'm not cooking yet."
It's not normal to say "I'm cooking yet". You might be able to in certain situations, but not neutral ones.


The hard form of polarity has to do with logical entailment, and can show up in entirely "positive" phrases. The simplest triggers of backwards polarity in positive phrases are "any" and "every". This is why some uses of も act funny. Questions can do this same thing. This is why か doesn't always make questions.


"Has anyone left yet?"
Another example of a word that dislikes neutral positive phrases is "ever".


"I hate everyone I've ever met."  

"I haven't ever said that."  

"Has he ever come?"
It would be unnatural to say "I have ever come" in a neutral situation.


The only way to explain this kind of polarity is to accept that the "direction" of "logical entailment" is what triggers different polarities, not negativity. One way to think about this is to think which way implications point when you negate things.


"I've had potato chips before" implies "I've had snacks before"  

"I haven't had potato chips before" doesn't imply "I haven't had snacks before"
In fact, the implication isn't just destroyed, it's outright reversed.


"I've had snacks before" doesn't imply "I've had potato chips before"  

"I haven't had snacks before" implies "I haven't had potato chips before"
Specific things imply general things. Specific things entail general things.


Polarity happens because some words only make sense when the "direction" of "entailment" is pointing a certain direction for what they're modifying.


"I haven't had snacks" is general in the sense that it leaves a lot open in the future, but it doesn't leave a lot open in the past. "haven't" implies that the past is fixed, the statement must be true in the past. But the future is still "general" because it's uncertain.


When you add "yet", it takes the statement and makes super sure that it's not implying anything about the future. It takes "uncertainty" about the future and turns it into "objective uncertainty" about the future. "Objective uncertainty" is more specific than "uncertainty".


With "I've had snacks", the future is already set in stone. You can't go to a future where the statement starts being false. There's no room for "yet" here, since "yet" operates on uncertain futures.


The only way for it to make sense is if the logic starts from "yet", like "I have yet to have snacks", which takes an uncertain future and puts a positive statement on it, and means basically the same as "I haven't had snacks yet".


When there isn't enough polarity at play, logical entailment can make things ambiguous. Polarity makes ambiguous combinations of entailment less common.


When you use words like this, you just know. You already know how to use them, where they can be used, how they work. In your head, it's not this complex.


At the very least, this is a good example why grammar can't really be taught.







### Part 5: Getting a point across


What can you do? A sword isn't enough to solve all the problems you run into. That bridge troll isn't taking money and food out of malice. He keeps the bridge from collapsing. You've gotta communicate so he knows why you can't pay.


*(By the way, starting now, some examples won't have translations.)*



#### Lesson 32: Just with だけ, のみ, ただ, ばかり, しか


だけ, のみ, ただ, and ばかり are variations of "just" or "only". しか is similar, but it has negative polarity.


だけ means "just so", in terms of amount. It acts like a particle.


俺だけ行く I'm the only one going (Metaphorically: "Only I will go")  

俺だけじゃないよ "It's not just me though."
のみ is like a less colloquial だけ that shows up in different grammar patterns.


ただの人間が存在するのみです There are only mere humans.
ただ is related to the idea of "just so", but it focuses on emphasis. Except for specific constructions (like ただの), taking a true sentence and adding ただ will result in another true sentence; this is not true of だけ or のみ.


僕はただ子供だよ I'm just a kid.
One construction where ただ is not just about emphasis is ただ一つ, where 一つ


ただ一つ問題がある There's just one problem.
たった is basically a variant of ただ.


ばかり is yet another "only" word. Like だけ and のみ, it changes what the sentence means. It can also be pronounced ばっか or ばっかり. ばかり focuses on *everything falling into this statement*, whereas だけ and のみ focus on *things falling outside of this statement being false*. ばかり is sometimes translated like "He always X" or "The only thing left to do now is X". ばかり cannot be used in negative environments.


犬ばかりだ It's nothing but dogs.
ばかり can also mean "just" in the time sense, usually with the past tense.


ばかり来たよ
しか is used with negative statements to say that the negative statement is true of everything except for what is tagged with しか, like "but".


僕しかいない Nobody but me is here.
Be careful, though, because しか can occur in grammar fossils like いつしか where it isn't a "but/except" word at all.
彼はいつしか行ってしまった He ended up leaving before anyone noticed.
Sometimes (but rarely), しか is used outside of complete statements.


「みんな来たの？」 「うん、彼しか」 "Did everyone come?" "Yeah, except him."
*Warning: the above example is completely contrived.*


The difference between しか and だけ in negatively-polarized statements is basically the reason that polarity exists.
僕しかいない Except for me, people are not here. (I'm the only one here.)  

僕だけいない Just me, I am not here. (I'm the only one not here.)
しか can be substituted with っきゃ.












#### Lesson 33: Still, already, and yet with もう まだ また


With positive statements, もう expresses "already". With negative statements, it works together with the negation to express "not anymore".


Basically, もう means that there's a change of state from the statement being false or irrelevant to the statement being true: "already" and "not anymore".


もうそんな時間ね That kind of time already, huh?  

もう食べた I already ate.  

もう食べない I won't eat anymore.  

もういいよ Metaphorically: "It's good already."  

もう！ Metaphorically: "Enough!"
In statements about the near future, もう can mean "soon" instead. This usually goes along with an adverb expressing soonness, but sometimes it's just implied.


Another use of もう expresses "more" of an amount. This has a different accent but it's usually considered the same word.


もう一回！ One more time!  

もうちょっと A bit more
まだ expresses the idea of "still" or "yet" as in the opposite of もう. It's used when a state stays the same.


まだ来た  

まだ食べるの？ You still eating?  

まだ負けないな！ I'm not beaten yet!  

まだまだ "Not yet!"
もう is used for "yet" in positive questions, since もう concerns a change, and まだ concerns staying the same. もう can still mean "already" in questions, though.


もう書きましたか？ Did you write it yet?  

もう眠いの？ Are you already sleepy?
また expresses the idea of "again". Try not to confuse this with まだ.


また来た He came again.  

また来ないな Looks like he's not coming, again.  

また来なかった Didn't come again.
The last three examples are slightly ambiguous, both in japanese and english.




#### Lesson 34: Not wanting with まい and permission with いい, ますか/ませんか


"Negative volition" means basically "determined not to X". There are several ways to express this in japanese. Most of them are phrased literally and you can figure them out with a dictionary, but まい deserves direct explanation.


まい is kind of a modern writing thing. Being modern means it shows in speech.


まい normally acts like some kind of auxiliary noun. However, for one-form verbs, it can also act as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the inherent base.


行くまい  

食べるまい  

食べまい  

来るまい  

するまい
For する and くる, you sometimes see すまい and こまい. しまい also happens.


まいとする expresses "try not to do X".


食べまいとする Trying not to eat
Negative volition can also invite ideas, just like positive volition (compare だろう, でしょう, etc). This is one of the more common uses of まい in speech.


そんなわけでもあるまい Such a thing is out of the question.
いい just means "good" or "fine" and isn't a grammatical term in itself, but it's used directly in patterns about permission.


食べていい？  

いいよ
When people use よかった they're normally expressing gladness, not goodness. よかった shouldn't be used for permission.


When negation is involved, "permission" statements with いい often walk the line between permission and request, just like excessively polite english. The くて form of い-adjectives can be used here, but acts like an entity, not as a linker, like how it's an entity in なくては.
食べないでいいよ (fine not to eat)  

食べなくていいよ (fine if you don't eat)
Sometimes, ますか and ませんか are a way of inviting permission politely, rather than asking a negative question. Think of this the same way as how ていい is used for permission even though it doesn't say "permission" anywhere.


食べますか Won't you eat?  

舐めてませんか？　ねえ？ Won't you try it? How about it?  

お仕事お休みできませんか……？ Is it impossible to take the day off...?






#### Lesson 35: More questions with っけ/け, かい, じゃない, and じゃん


っけ/け is used to ask positive "confirmation" questions, as well as questions about something the speaker forgot about.
なんだっけ？ "What was it again?"  

どこに置いたっけ "Oh, where'd I put it?"
っけ/け is almost never used with non-nouns except in the past tense. When it is, other stuff is usually put in between.


来るんだっけ
In kansai and some other dialects け is a rough-sounding alternative か.


かい is a "friendly" question marker, especially for masculine speakers. Outside of familiar conversation, it's usually rude. It's か + い, and this い can show up attached to other stuff as well, like だ.


お元気かい？ You doin' well?
じゃない is used to ask confirmation questions. Yes, when attached to nouns, it's identical to normal "is not". No, there's no way around it.


いいじゃない It's fine, isn't it?
じゃん is a contraction of じゃない, but only used for confirmation questions.








#### Lesson 36: Making lists with や and とか and と and か


While english makes lists by separating words separated by pauses, with the nature of the list indicated by filler words or conjunctions ("like", "and", "or the likes", etc), japanese usually tags each item individually, with the tag expressing the nature of the list.


Tagging items individually is grammatically simpler in japanese. The final instance of an individual tag is usually dropped with the simpler tags.


や makes a non-exhaustive list, and doesn't strictly require each item, but the idea of them as a class of things is maintained.


スプーンやフォークで食べること To eat with spoons or forks (or the likes).
と was covered as a side-note before, but here we'll cover it explicitly and compare it to や. と makes a "generic" list. It's not necessarily exhaustive, but still counts each item individually.


リンゴと魚とタイヤキを食べた Ate taiyaki, fish, and apples.
とか makes a "vague" list. It's vague, and therefore non-exhaustive, but each item is its own; the items aren't treated as a class of things. 


スプーンとかフォークで食べること To eat with a spoon or fork (or something).
か can be used in a similar way, but lists alternatives.


In fact, とか is the combination of と and か, both as listing particles. と makes a generic list of individual things, か makes a list of alternatives, and とか makes a general list of individual alternatives.


The above explanations are not literal. Japanese people don't think "I'm going to make a class of things and use や to list examples of it". Because the markers don't have 1:1 matches in english, the explanation has to be abstract. Please remember that japanese is just another language, and native speakers go through similar mental processes to what you do in your own native language.




#### Lesson 37: Getting self-conscious with より and counting with つ


より is used to compare two things in a direct way, like the "than" in "I'm smarter than you". When you use より, you do not need to use a "more" word, unlike how english needs to say "more X than Y" or "Xer than Y".


彼は誰よりも強いよ  

He's stronger than anyone, dude.
より is also used in constructions about relative position (in space or time), and acts like "from" or "compared to" rather than "than" in these situations.


東京より北 North of Tokyo  

新世界より From the New World
When you want to qualify an object as having a specific number/count, you don't just glue the number together with the object like you do in english ("five men"). In japanese, only "counter words" can accept numbers directly. This serves a similar role to english phrases like "four heads of cow".
The most common counter word is つ.


一つ　ひとつ  

二つ　ふたり  

三つ　みっつ  

四つ　よっつ  

五つ　いつつ  

六つ　むっつ  

七つ　ななつ  

八つ　やっつ  

九つ　ここのつ  

十　　とお (not a counter)
The above numbers come from the native japonic number system. Japanese has a second number system which it adopted from china, which begins with "ichi, ni, san ...", etc. Both systems are used everywhere, but aren't interchangeable. Some counters use only japonic numbers, some use only the numbers from china, and some use a specific mix of both, differing for different values.


Here's an example of counters in use:


もう一つ質問 Still one question  

たった１つの風呂 Just one bath  

でも１つ間違ってるぞ But you got one thing wrong!
In japanese, "countable words" are a closed set, made up entirely of these counters. In english, almost every word is countable. For example, "money" is an uncountable word. You can't say "I have a hundred money".


*(To students of grammar: つ was a genitive marker in very olden times)*








#### Lesson 38: なる and でできる, bonus causative せる, and reviewing the passive


Japanese has phrasal verbs, just like english. Phrasal verbs are basically verb-based phrases that have their own definitions, like "turn into".
なる is a verb meaning something like "become" or "ending up being". In addition to just "become", it can be used for all sorts of indirect states, like a team ending up being its members, or a rumor turning out to be true.


俺、ツインテールになります I will become twintails.
Despite being described as になる, it actually takes an adverb as the argument of なる, not just nouns marked with に. に basically acts as an adverbial marker for nouns. The phrase we're looking at here is <adverb>なる, not になる. There are even phrases with the string になる that aren't necessarily <adverb>なる, like のためになる.


The く form of い-adjectives is adverbial. Compare くなる to くない:


強くなれば If I become strong  

強くなければ If I am not strong
Note that ければ on i-adjectives can be spoken as けりゃ or きゃ: 強くなきゃ.


When になります is being used in the particular type of polite speech used by service job workers, it has a nuance based on になる, but doesn't literally mean the same thing. Blame keigo.


出来る できる is a verb about being "made", complete, or even "made out of". It **also** replaces the missing potential form of する.


The phrase でできる means "be made out of":


この体は、無限の剣で出来ていた。  

This body was made out of infinite swords.
でできる usually, but not always, takes the form でできている when used like this. Also, できる doesn't **require** the で before it for it to talk about being made out of something, just like なる and becoming.


せる is a "causative" verb form. It means the action of making or letting someone do something. Yes, it's used for both, and that's why it has a vague name like causative.


For five-form verbs, せる attaches to the "none such" form. For one-form verbs, さ is inserted between せる and the verb's *one and only base*.


終わらせる・死なせる・食べさせる To make/let someone/something end/die/eat
Causation is the logical opposite of a passive. The relationship between the subject and verb changes in the opposite direction. When you use the passive and causative together, your subject is the one doing the core action again, but because of the causative and passive, the meaning is no longer the same.


書かせる To make \_\_\_ write (not the one doing the writing)  

書かれる To be written (not the one doing the writing)  

書かせられる To be made to write (the one doing the writing)
Reality check: a short form of the causative verb exists in the spoken language, and isn't considered wrong there. Replace せる with す. Supposedly, this doesn't apply to one-form verbs or す verbs, but don't hold your breath.


書かす
Causative-passive still applies, as if the す were a five-form verb ending.


書かされる






#### Lesson 39: Reflexes with 自分


In english, you don't say "Jim broke Jim's watch" when there's just one Jim. You say "Jim broke his watch", or sometimes "Jim broke his own watch". You don't say "Jim hurt Jim", or "Jim hurt him", you say "Jim hurt himself".


"His own" and "himself" have the property of being "reflexive". You already know how it works, "reflexive" is just the jargon used for it. When you need to do something reflexive in japanese, 自分 fulfills this behavior.


自分の体を食べた It eats its own flesh  

自分で遊ぶ Plays by himself  

お前、自分で… You, on your own...
自分 is also used in some dialects (and systems of slang) as a general personal pronoun, usually for the first person, but sometimes the second. It can be used like that in normal speech too, since it's a vague way to talk about someone.




#### Optional Lesson 2: Bonus auxiliaries: 見る, とする, と思う, と決める


Many ordinary verbs have additional uses as "auxiliary" verbs, verbs attached to the end of the verb-sticky form or て form of another verb. Instead of meaning what they normally mean, they're used to express things that japanese doesn't have dedicated verbal conjugations for.


Most of these are very easy to pick up from reading, except for how complicated とする is. とする has enough to say about it that I consider it advanced grammar, which is the only reason it's buried away in this optional lesson rather than being put in the later course lesson on "aspect".


見る, in the construction てみる, as in 食べてみる, indicates that the action is "tried", or being done "to see what happens". This can overlap with the normal meaning of みる, but not always.


読んで見る I'll read it and see (what it's like).  

食べてみる I'll try to eat it.
In the next three auxiliaries, the と is the embedded clause marker. This might help you understand how that use of と works.


とする has three main uses. The first means that someone supposes/assumes something, used with statements. Think of it like "pretend that/act as though". This is easiest to see as an invitation, but can be part of a longer sentence about someone else's presumptions too.


それが犬だとする Let's say that's the dog.  

来たとする Assume it came.
The second is として, with a general vague "operating as X" meaning. This is directly related to the first use, think of it like "thinking of Y as an X", but it doesn't work the same way psychologically.


研究者として As a researcher
The third use means that something undergoes an "experiential" state, basically used with "mimetic" words like つるつる "slick".


つるっとする It goes "slurp"
と思う has two main uses.


Normally, と思う means that the **speaker** thinks something.


来たと思った I thought that it came.
When と思う is used with a volitional phrase, it can mean the speaker thinks that they should do something.


食べようと思う I think I should eat.
When the speaker wants to talk about someone else supposing that they should do something, they have to use the ている form of と思う.


彼は勉強しようと思っている He thinks he might as well study.



### Part 6: Putting things together


Beware the Jabberwock, my son. A heated discussion bears only ill fruit. Dragons are proud, so letting them make you do something silly like get rat tails might humor them, but Jabberwocks compromise with noone. The only way to stop a Jabberwock is to tangle it in its own verbal gospel. Tear it apart.



#### Lesson 40: Being more negative: なくて, ないで, and ず and ずに


We briefly covered なくて and ないで before in the context of ください. Let's cover them properly.


なくて is the て "particle". When it acts as a conjunction (and not a topic), なくて usually implies that a negative statement is the reason for another statement. It doesn't *always* imply a reason, though.


早く起きなくて　仕事に遅れた
ないで can be a conjunction too. Unlike なくて, it doesn't carry the "reason" nuance. Sometimes it has the nuance that Y happens without X happening, but this is something you shouldn't worry about it till you're adept at japanese.


話せないで殺す He kills without talking.
Covered earlier, ないで is also used for conjugations like ないでください.


This calls back to the made-up distinction I made between the て "particle" and "form" early on in this guide. The て particle is "just" a conjunction, and connects two events. The て form, however, is a conjunction **or** a linking form. For verbs, they are identical, but for adjectives like ない, the two possible forms have a strict distinction, and they are not equivalent.


One way of seeing the difference between なくて and ないで is that なくて implies that, at some point in time, something specifically doesn't happen. In grammar terms, なくて is never truly an infinitive. This is the reason that なくて cannot link verbs like in ないでいる or ないでください.


Remember, て "form" vs "particle" is an abstraction. It's only meant to help you remember how なくて and ないで are different. Native japanese speakers don't literally think about なくて and ないで in this way. They have a deep and unspeakable intuition that can't be explained, no matter how hard anyone tries. When you consume enough japanese input, you'll gain the same intuition.


ず is an archaic negative suffix. It goes in place of ない, except for する where the form is せずに. It can be conjugated, but you won't see it conjugated anywhere in modern japanese, because it's fossilized and acts like a conjunction instead of something you can conjugate.


ず is essentially only used as a conjunction meaning "without \_ing". This overlaps with ないで, but there are differences in nuance.


ずに is how ず is normally used in modern japanese, but it can go either way.


一言も話さずに終わった Ended it without saying a single thing.


#### Lesson 41: If and when with と たら なら


と is used to link two events where one is a natural consequence of the other, in a strongly sequential way.


飲み続けると危ない薬 Medicine that's dangerous if you keep taking it.
たら is used to link two events where one sequentially comes after the other, but without literally stating that there's a direct causation between the two.


たら attaches to the reduced verb-sticky form.


私と話しててもつまらないんだったら私帰るわ  

I'll go home if it's boring just talking to me.  

(note: the doubled て comes from ている -> てる -> てて)
Because it doesn't state direct causation, it's very appropriate for questions that depend on something hypothetical.


来たらどうですか How about you come over?
*(Side note: たらどうですか is sometimes treated like its own construction.)*


なら is used when the speaker supposes the first statement is true, and that it implies that the second statement is true. There's basically no restriction on sequence or causation here, only the nature of the truth of the statements. In fact, the second statement can "happen" before the conditional statement does, which other condition constructions can't do.


Normally, なら only attaches to nouns. When you use なら with verbs and い-adjectives, it's normal to attach の as a nominalizer (see Lesson 31). However, putting の between the verb/い-adjective and なら is optional.


Using の can give the nuance that the condition is a instance of the statement, like being sick. Dropping の can give the nuance that the condition is a general thing that might not be true right now, like when it rains.


The meaning of なら does not change because of adding the の. The difference in nuance comes from the verb or い-adjective being nominalized, not の coming before なら. The exact meaning of the statement does not change much.


行くのなら If you're going  

行くなら If you go
Sometimes なら is said as ならば. In fact, ならば is where なら comes from. This ば is the one we already know.


*(To students of grammar: ならば comes from にあり (see also: にてあり/である) -> なり -> ならば. Not from なる (become). なら is the 未然形 of なり. In fact, this is one of the reasons I didn't call the 未然形 form "imperfective": it's a misnomer. And "irrealis" overreaches. "None such" is at worst meaningless.)*




#### Lesson 42: Concurrence with ながら あいだ うちに つつ


ながら states that two events are concurrently true. In the loose sense, they take place concurrently.


The left-hand event before ながら must be secondary to the event after ながら. The distinction is only intuitive, and affects what kinds of uses of ながら are acceptable. This sort of secondariness doesn't necessarily translate into english putting the left-hand event after a "while", it's just a tendency.


ながら attaches to the verb-sticky form of a verb.


読みながら眠ってしまう Ends up falling asleep while reading  

ラテを飲みながら考える Thinks while drinking a latte.
ながら can not be used when the events have different subjects. In that case, あいだ/あいだに is used.


間/あいだ says that two events cover the same span of time. This places constraints on what sorts of statements it accepts. 間 itself acts like a noun.


食べる間、考える Thinking the whole time while eating
間に says that the event after 間に starts and ends within the span of time when the event before 間に is happening.


うちに says that an event happens while the statement before うちに is true, but generally instead of strictly. The statement before うちに is subject to various restrictions.


雨が降らないうちに帰ろう  

Let's return while it's not raining (nuance: before it rains)
つつ, as in XつつY, is a formal-sounding "while" conjunction. Unlike many of the above, it just states that the events are concurrent, not which started when. Like ながら, the subject of both events must be the same.


Because つつ is formal, it is not normal to use it for everyday activities like "I am currently preparing breakfast". You can think of it like it implies that the events are special or occasional.


In general, つつ is an auxiliary conjunction that states that the left-hand event is in progress, and XつつY is just a use of it. In the pattern つつある, it states that the event is progressive, like one of the meanings of ている.




#### Lesson 43: Adversatives with が けど けれど しかし ても and でも


Unrelated to the subject marker が, the conjunction が states that, while the former statement is true, the latter statement is also true. With が, both statements are independent clauses.


そうですが、もう終わりだ That's true, but it's already over.
が attaches to what comes before it like a particle or suffix. が does not attach to the sentence that comes after it like the english "but".


が is sometimes not used as a strict adversity between the two statements, but to connect two related sentences smoothly. Like how I just used "but". Spoken english does the same thing with "but", but sometimes to a confusing degree.


けど is similar to が except the first statement is a subordinate clause. This primarily affects how the syntax works. For example, with が, the two clauses usually have similar levels of formality, but with けど, this is not the case.


高いですけど買おう The price is high but let's buy it.
けど is more weakly bounded than が, so it can be used in confusing ways.


いいけど "It's good, but..." **or** "It's good, though."
けど is the most informal version of けれども. There's also けども and けれど.


しかし is an interjection. It sounds formal.


しかし知らなかった However, I didn't know.
ても is a combination of the て particle/form of a verb and も. It works as a conjunction stating that the statement after it is true despite the statement before it. This is *like* an adversative, but it's not always one.


死んでも死なない I don't die even if I die.
Reality check: you might see い-adjectives take the ても form like なかっても instead of なくても, especially on the internet, but it's abnormal grammar and I can't tell you anything about what the difference implies.


でも is an adversative interjection, or a conjunction that attaches to nouns. This overlaps with a different use of でも that we'll cover soon, so be careful.


でも、そんなことないです But it's not like that.  

無理でも大空に羽ばたけ！ Fly into the sky, even if it's impossible!
だが, だけど, それでも etc are similar interjections made by compounding stuff.




#### Lesson 44: Entailment with から そして ので で


から, not just a case particle, is also a conjunction where the thing after から is "because of" the thing before から. This is called entailment.


いいから止まれ It's fine, so stop.
から is only an interjection in compounds such as だから and ですから. Keep in mind that だから and ですから can occur naturally when から is a conjunction too.


犬だから怖い It's scary because it's a dog.
そして is an interjection that essentially means "therefore". It has a tone similar to "therefore" too, maybe polite rather than formal.


そして起きなかった Therefore he didn't wake up.
ので acts like から. However, ので is allowed in fewer situations than から. ので wants both statements to be real statements, not invitation or conjecture. This narrows down the ways you can interpret the statement in.


実家に帰ったので Because I returned to where I grew up.
ので for nouns is なので, not だので. ので and のだ are related, which is why のだ has the nuance "the reason for something". The more you know.


ので is more "objective" and has less emphasis than other adversatives, which means that it's sometimes used to link two statements that just so happen to have a cause/effect relationship.


で can be used as a conjunction similar to "so". The meaning here is more of a feeling and less of a literal meaning. で is deep in the "academic papers" feeling if it's formal, but it can also be used in rough spoken japanese.


で、おまえは誰だ So just who are you?
This で is the て "particle" of だ. It's the で in the conjunction でも, where も changes it from marking entailment to being adversative.


Words like これ and それ can be combined with conjunctive particles like で (but not limited to で) to narrow down where the entailment is coming from.


それで、ツインテールになる？ You'll become twintails, then?
Things like それから also exist and have their own nuances.




#### Lesson 45: Linking conjunctions のに ように ために せいで だって し


のに is related to ので, but it works in the opposite direction: "even though". Like ので, this is more "objective" than other adversatives. のに also loves being attached to the end of sentences, but remember, it's a conjunction.


ええ～、俺の話なのに Oh? Despite my story?
A second use of のに makes an entire phrase be an adverb, modifying the second phrase. You can remember this use of のに by thinking that it adds の to the first phrase on its own, then adds に, whereas the previous use of のに is a compound. What comes before のに here is always an informal non-past expression. Its most common use is "in order to" as in "in the process of".


黙らせるのには些細な威圧でいい A little "coercion" is fine in silencing people.
The は is not always there.


The two uses of のに can be ambiguous, but context always fills in the gaps.


ように essentially means "so as to", as in "walk so as to keep your back hidden". This walks a fine line between "for the purpose of" and "in such a way as", and ように even has the nuance of walking the line between the two.


離れすぎないように歩く Walking in a way to not separate too much
ように has a second use, but it isn't as bad as のに. The second use here just means "in such a way as X". Note that I didn't write "in such a way that X".


当然のように女物だ It's feminine, as it would be. (liberal translation of 女物)
Be careful not to confuse this with the volitional よう plus に.


ために literally uses the noun ため "purpose" plus に to make a conjunction. The example uses a その, but the purpose can be anything attributive.


そのために仲間を殺せ。 For that purpose kill your comrades.
せい is a noun meaning "fault" used to indicate cause/blame/reason. It usually implies that the effect is undesirable in some way.


私のせいだ！ It's my fault!  

あの鳥が変なことを言うせいだ　It's because that bird is saying weird things.
せい earns its place here because of せいで, which acts like a conjunction meaning "because of". Like ために, せいで doesn't need a statement as its left-hand argument (e.g. 私のせいで), and doesn't express logical entailment.


し is used to link two statements with a feeling of emphasis. Note that this is not the grammar being used in things like 話し (verb) or なし (adjective).
ちゃんとご飯も食べるし、睡眠も取る  

Eating all our meals together and even going to bed together.  

("together" in the translation comes from context not shown in this excerpt)






#### Lesson 46: Aspect with てしまう, ていく, てくる, ておく, ておる


"Aspect" is how a statement interacts with time in ways other than "when the statement happened". Aspect comes into play when you want to say something has "already" happened, or "is fated to" happen, and so on, without adverbs.


Several things we already covered, like ている and てある, are about aspect.


てしまう indicates that something is "complete", "done completely". It's also used when things "end up" in such a "complete" state, like after mistakes. A good way to remember this is to think about "it's done" and "now I've done it".


てしまう can also be ちまう or ちゃう in speech (even voiced, like 死んじゃう). ちゃ～ isn't always てしま～. For example, なくちゃダメ is なくてはダメ.


When ていく doesn't just mean "go and", it means that something is ongoing and will "keep going" at least into the near future. ていく can be spoken as てく.


When てくる doesn't just mean "come and", it means that something was ongoing and has continued into the immediate present, and might go further.


ておく means to do something as a preparation. ておく can be said as とく


ておる is a humble/formal variant of ている. おる and いる have a similar relationship. ておる can be spoken as とる.


Aspectual things happen relative to whatever the "reference" time is. This "reference" time is usually just the tense of statement, but things like narration and quotation mess with how tense and time interact.




#### Lesson 47: The normalization of でも and だって


だって is similar to でも. Review Lesson 24 if needed. The feeling here is to go against something, or quote something, or give something a reason, which basically means it has a general explanatory tone. There's an unspeakable intuition here.


だって、ほんとに可愛いのに But like, even though it really is cute.
Sometimes だって acts like a particle. It means something similar to でも in these situations, though context can make it mean "also".


子供だって出来る Even a kid can do it.
だって is colloquial.
When you attach でも directly to a noun, strange things can happen. This でも has a different nuance than the conjunction.


いぬでもいいです  

Even a dog is fine.
When an interrogative like 何 is buried inside a phrase conjugated to ても, it ends up acting like the above. In fact, this calls back to when we learned about でも turning interrogatives into "any X" words. Polarity is responsible.


何食べても美味しそう Whatever I eat it seems to taste good.  

何でも食べる I eat anything.
Because of polarity, でも as in "even" plays strangely with negatives.


Sometimes, like in volitional or imperative statements, でも can mark something vague that can be substituted. "Even" is a useful part of the intuition here, but it doesn't literally translate well to english. This is the use of でも that you have to be careful about when you consider the "even" meaning.


お茶でも飲みませんか  

Would you like to drink tea or the likes?  

Would you like to drink some tea?
To review the many basic uses of ても/でも:


死んでも死なない I don't die even if I die.  

いぬでもいいです Even a dog is fine.  

何食べても美味しそう Whatever I eat it seems to taste good.  

お茶でも飲みませんか Would you like to drink tea or the likes?
Remember, these are all different and overlap with だって at least a little.








#### Optional Lesson 3: Formal logical conjunctions または, あるいは, 及び, and more


These conjunctions have their own section because they're very easy to learn by exposure when you read. They're basically words of their own. That said, please skip this lesson until you need it. Optional lessons are optional.


Every term in this lesson is usually a written construction, though they can be spoken. Also, the は at the end of a couple of these is the topic marker.


または (又は) separates mutually exclusive options. Normally, it only separates two items, but said items can be lists themselves. Note that または has complex syntax restrictions on what it can attach to.


来るか、または連絡する  

Comes, otherwise communicates  

  

犬、または猫  

A dog **or** a cat
もしくは (若しくは) is another logical conjunction meaning "or". Unlike または, it isn't specifically mutually exclusive. It just presents two alternatives.


死ぬか、もしくは死亡する  

Die, or pass away
あるいは (或いは) is another alternative-presenting conjunction, but this time it has another common use. In addition to acting like "or", it can also act like an interjection that just emphasize the possibility of something.


及び is a logical "and". It doesn't just note that both of the items apply to the statement, it notes that they apply **together**. In this way, it's similar to と (but stricter) when と is used as a logical "and". 及び is formal. Unlike と, 及び can operate on more kinds of objects.


並びに works much like 及び. 並びに can only be used with one set of two items. However, 並びに and 及び can be used together to control the order in which items are combined together.


ものの (物の) has the same general meaning as the conjunction が, but has different restrictions on when it's used. For example, ものの cannot be followed up with a question or a volitional/invitational statement.





### Part 7: Relatively speaking


Tomorrow, the world is in danger. For the sake of time, for the sake of a new today, you have to stop someone from going back to the world of yesterday.



#### Lesson 48: Expectation with わけ, はず, べき, べし, ものだ, かもしれない


わけ is a noun meaning "reason" (as in "why"). At the end of a statement, it says a reason for something was identified through deduction/judgment.


Use one: the speaker knows something that's relevant, and they're making a statement to put emphasis on the fact that it's true and relevant right now. According to that fact or reason, something else is to be expected.


つまり、私たちは餌というわけですね  

Basically, it's a matter of fact that we're food.  

(There's a reason to know that we're food)
You can imagine that they're in trouble or there's something wrong with them.


Use two: one thing leads to another, based on fact. When negated, you can think of it as a way to refute an expectation that didn't follow good reasoning.


魔術師の家系の子供は、それだけで魔術に適した人間ってわけ。  

That reason alone is why the children of magical lineages are suited to magic.  

  

年齢でクラスが決まってるわけじゃないの。  

There's no reason for classes to be decided based on age.
はず expresses that the speaker expects something to factually be true or come true. The english "should" expresses both this and "subjective" expectation, i.e. that it would be bad otherwise, so it's not a 1:1 match. はず also implies that the expectation is based on reasoning and is not pure conjecture.


高かったはずだ It must've been expensive.  

優しいはずだ She should be kind. (I'm pretty sure she's kind)
べき states that the speaker expects a certain action or state, because otherwise it would be bad, irresponsible, etc.


When in the past tense like べきだった (or similar), it says that an action or state "was" or "would have been" right, usually the latter.


べし is an archaic version of べき. You're unlikely to run into it, but you never know with fiction.


ものだ can also express "should" with the nuance that it's a general "should" that applies to a lot of people, not just a specific person or a group. This only applies when it's being used for mood reasons, just like のだ. You should also watch out for ものを, another confusing use of もの.


かもしれない is a compound sentence-ending particle. It attaches the same way as か alone does. It expresses that the speaker thinks the statement is a possibility. Sometimes people attach this to things they know are true for politeness's sake.


悪質ではあるかもしれないけど―― Though it may be volatile...


#### Lesson 49: Approximately ころ, くらい, たり, and limits with まで, ほど, すぎる


ころ is a noun that basically means "approximate time". You run into Xのころに a lot. This can either be a conjunction "around the time of X", or a noun "the general time when X" with the に particle attached.


When it acts as a suffix, ころ is voiced, becoming ごろ. ごろ attaches to a noun that takes a "specific point in time" (not a length of time) and makes it be vague and approximate. In any case, it shouldn't be used with nonspecific spans of time that are already vague.


くらい・ぐらい takes a span and makes it approximate. 三か月ぐらい basically means "for around three months". くらい can also be used to compare things like より, and says that they're about the same.


たり is used to list statements in an inexhaustive and nonspecific way, much like the listing particle や. It attaches the same way as the past tense, so it can come out as だり, and sometimes it's treated like <past>+り.


まで essentially means "up to" or "until". Unlike "until" (like "until friday"), まで does not explicitly exclude what it marks.


月曜日から金曜日まで  

Monday through friday (including monday and friday)
まで can be used with verb phrases, but it can only be attached to informal, tenseless statements. In other words, they have to be plain and not past tense.


Reality check: までに is a compound particle meaning "at some time before" rather than "to the point through".


ほど essentially means "as" in terms of a comparison. For some left-hand arguments of ほど, the statement being compared has to be negative. In such comparisons, ほど acts as a limit on how well the statement applies.


君ほど強くない Not as strong as you
In positive statements where ほど attaches to an "amount", it's approximate.


半分ほど食べた I ate around half.
Compounds like それほど act as their own thing and have different semantics than their parts combined. それほど means something like "that much".


過ぎる すぎる is a verb and means "exceed" or "surpass". As an auxiliary verb, すぎる means "too much" or an excess, and attaches to the verb-sticky form.


食べすぎる Eating too much  

優しすぎる Too kind


#### Lesson 50: Doing the time with 後, 前/先, 時 (note さっき)


後・あと is a noun that means "after". X後で is a conjunction saying that something happens after X, and not necessarily immediately.


前・まえ is an antonym of 後 and means "before". 前 can both mean before in the spatial sense (i.e. in front of you) and in the time sense (i.e. the past). This is unintuitive because of the notion of "putting the past behind you", but if you remember that "People in front of you in line are Before Your Presence and Do Things Before You", you'll do fine.


The conjunction X前に means something happens before X does, not necessarily immediately. X前に can also just be a noun acting as the argument of a verb, in which case it means "in front of" in the spatial sense.


前 and 先 are almost synonyms.


先 is a noun meaning "before", "ahead", or "front end". Generally, when 先 is spatial, it means the front ("head") of something, or the direction it's headed, not the location immediately in front of it.


先 has two contradictory temporal uses.


Temporal use one means that something is ahead of something else, right now. A teacher is ahead of a student in life. It could also be something that happened just a moment ago.


Temporal use two means that something lies ahead, in the future. A career lies ahead of a student.


These uses seem contradictory, but they have the same fundamental idea. The contradiction only happens when you give the word "before" in some situations and "ahead" in others. English does the same thing and it's just as confusing.


This is a convenient way to remember that 先 doesn't arbitrarily change between being a word for temporal past and future. Instead, it depends on the situation or phrase, just like the english word "ahead".


The conjunction X先に works almost exactly the same way as X前に.


さっき is a version of 先 that is exclusively used as a "moment ago" time noun.


時 is a noun that means "time", but if you give it a relative clause, it can act like a conjunction.


また繋げたい時は言ってね  

Tell me when you want to connect again, 'kay?


#### Lesson 51: Likeness with らしい ぽい そう など


らしい is an auxiliary adjective that attaches to nouns or verbs/adjectives and says that something factually "seems so" based on circumstance. らしい is appropriate for things that would translate to "seems X", rather than "Xish".


ぽい (almost always っぽい) says that something subjectively "seems so" based on appearance or properties and translates well as "Xish" or "X-like".


We've seen そう before in a couple example sentences with the pattern "そうだ", where we translated it as "is so", where "so" meant "like that". That's a literal use of そう as a noun. There are two grammatical constructions that use そう that have a different meaning than just "like that".


Use one is "seeming", where そう attaches directly to a verb or adjective's stem, including な-adjectives (where the stem just lacks the な・だ). This is sometimes used like "seems like I will X" with non-volitional future actions. Notably, A Frequency Dictionary of Japanese interprets that as "about to X".


食べられそう  

Seems edible
Use two is "hearsay", much like らしい, except that it attaches to statements rather than individual words. If you want, you can think of this as "it seems that \_\_\_" until it clicks in your head.


Finally, など basically means "etc", "and so on", or "and the like". Sometimes it's the final grammatical word in a list, especially vague or non-exhaustive ones, and it can turn exhaustive, concrete types of lists into non-exhaustive ones, without changing the nuance.


謝罪など、全く無用の事です Apologies and such, very much useless things.


#### Lesson 52: Being done for someone with やる あげる もらう くれる


As a normal verb, やる is highly contextual, and you might as well treat it like its meaning depends on the structure it's in. It's a "do" word, but it's more general than する, and it has different connotations.


As an auxiliary verb, やる expresses that the action was in some way undesirable to someone involved, like doing something at their expense.


ケーキを食べてやった  

I ate the cake (at someone's expense)  

  

怒鳴り付けてやった  

I shouted at him (even though he wouldn't want it)
あげる is a "give" word. In the structure てあげる, it means that someone did the action "for the sake of" someone else. But there's a catch: When it's the core of the independent statement itself, and not hidden away inside a relative clause or modified in such a way, it never refers to an action done for the sake of the speaker (nor for the sake of someone the speaker is speaking for).


There's no good term for this, but a new one that might gain some traction is "private predicate". If the speaker (or someone they're speaking for) is the person receiving the good will of the action, and the action isn't embedded or relative, the speaker can't use てあげる. A native japanese speaker will refuse, on a grammatical level, to think that the speaker is the receiver.


This is a way of avoiding ambiguity when talking about giving and receiving with dropped subjects. But even with an explicit subject, you can't use the speaker as the receiver of てあげる. You need to use くれる instead.


もらう is similar to あげる, but means "getting" instead of "giving".


もらう almost acts like a passive. The receiver of the action is marked as the subject and not the indirect object. This is what it means when I say it refers to "getting" and not "giving". もらう is also the opposite of あげる in that the speaker cannot be the giver of the action.


The speaker will not be marked as the indirect object of a もらう or あげる statement that the speaker is making, even though the speaker has different roles in both kinds of statements.


あげる is sometimes used when the giver and receiver are both third parties. Then the speaker is implying that they empathize with whoever was giving.


もらう means the receiver is the speaker or someone they empathize with.


くれる is a "give" word, but it works like the opposite of あげる. The speaker (or their party) must be the one receiving the action, and cannot be marked as the giver. When the speaker is the giver, あげる has to be used.


When the giver or receiver is not stated explicitly, you need to understand the rules above in order to understand who's playing what role. That's the only reason I bothered to explain what's going on. If it's hard to understand, skip it, try to learn it through exposure, and maybe come back here later.


Some linguists consider this a special case of subject-verb agreement. If you come from a language with pervasive subject-verb agreement, that might be a more intuitive way to think about this for you. But I don't know how well the idea fits, so if you want to think about this like agreement, be careful, I don't know what to warn you about.




#### Lesson 53: Wrongness with だめ, いけない, ならない, featuring "must", and bonus, some contractions


だめ is a word that means something like "no good", "useless", or "no use". It can be used to say that a statement would be bad, after turning the statement into a noun or a conjunction.


ならない and いけない similar to だめ, but they're strong enough to say that something is prohibited.


ならない and いけない are relatively common, because they're used in a very common double negative construction that means "must".


なければならない
There are several variations on this. They boil down to "not to X" "wrong".


なければならない  

なければいけない  

ねばならない  

ねばならぬ  

なかったらいけない  

なくてはいけない  

etc.
Different ways of forming it have different flavors, levels of strength, and implications about why or in what way it must be done.


ならない is slightly stronger than いけない. ならない has the connotation of mental things that make something undoable, and いけない has the connotation of something being prohibited, but this distinction is in no way objective, and doesn't represent how japanese natives think about it.


On the topic of there being a million ways to say something, there are some contractions that you have to watch out for if you don't have a lot of experience reading. Here are a few. Contractions that were explicitly explained elsewhere in this guide, they aren't listed. Always be careful about contractions in speech and dialogue.




| Phrase | Contraction |
| なにするの？ | なにすんの？ |
| なにをしてるのだ | なにをしてんだ |
| 来るな・くるな | 来んな・くんな |
| (surname)さんのうち | (surname)さんち |
| わからない | わかんない |
| わからない | わからねー |
| すごい | すげー |




#### Lesson 54: "Oh well" and "I can't help it" with "It can't be helped"


There's two basic forms of this expression, differing in whether they use よう・様 or かた・方.
しようがない・しょうがない・etc  

しかたがない・しかたない・etc
Both of them are literally し(する) + よう・かた (way to X) + [が]ない.


The literal meaning of ～よう・かたがない is "there's no way to X". しよう・かたがない can use this meaning, too, in the right context.


書きようがない No way to write
But as a set phrase, しようがない and friends are their own thing, and take on the meaning "oh well", "I can't help it", "there's no two ways about it", etc. English has a bunch of phrases for this kind of idea with different nuances.


This sort of expression shows up in every human language, but the way it's worded in japanese has been exoticized, thanks to shitty translations repeatedly using "it can't be helped".


While grammatically correct, and a valid phrase, and one that people might use in natural english, overusing "it can't be helped" in translations has basically made しようがない have a mythical status as something that has an untranslatable meaning. It's not untranslatable. Especially because many uses of しようがない just mean "there's no way to do X". Not all of them are "oh well".


There's something very important to learn here. Your dictionary is not an authority on what something **does** mean, only an authority on what something **might** mean. Just because しようがない has the translation "it can't be helped" in a dictionary, it doesn't mean that you **must** interpret it that way. What you feel like it means is more important than what your dictionary says.








#### Optional Lesson 4: Under the rug: A mess of particles and auxiliaries


These common important intermediate words aren't present in this guide. They're not present in any of the main lessons because they don't stick well into them, and because they're not particularly annoying.


Most of these are listing particles or emphatic particles that are hard to forget and easy to get a feel for. Let's sweep them under the rug.


なり can be a list marker that marks examples of possible options.


きり・っきり is a particle with two meanings.


In the pattern <noun>きり, it acts like an "only" marker.


In the pattern <statement>っきり, it basically means "ever since <statement>".


Some set phrases like 思いっきり, すっきり, てっきり, and はっきり contain the kana っきり, but aren't using the meaning described above.


やら is another particle with two meanings.


It can be used at the end of a statement to make an introspective question. This isn't just a modal particle, it can also be used in the middle of a statement, just like か.


It can also be used to list possibilities/examples, like か for alternatives.


こそ is an emphatic particle that acts a lot like stressing the word in english. In other words, it literally emphasizes whatever it attaches to. You can also think of it like "for sure" until it clicks in your head.


さえ is an emphatic particle that means "even an X", or "only an X", depending on the phrase and its polarity. まで can also be used this way, but not in negative/conditional phrases, and thus never means "only an X".


すら is a slightly literary emphatic particle very similar to さえ. すら can replace さえ when さえ means "even an X".


These sorts of "even an X" emphasis overlap with some uses of も and , which is why でも and だって were so hard to explain.


すぐ is an adverbial noun that means "immediately", either in a temporal way or in a spatial way. You can construct both "right in front of" and "right away" with it. すぐに basically means "soon".


ずつ is a particle that means "each" or "at a time". It emphasizes that the pace of something is steady, rather than just having an average rate.


がる is an auxiliary verb that means that someone other than the speaker (remember the "private predicate") shows signs of something. たがる is a combination of たい and がる, meaning someone looks like they want to do something.


がち is an auxiliary verb that means that someone or something has a tendency. The tendency is usually undesirable from an outside view.
