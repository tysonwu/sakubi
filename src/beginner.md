--------------------------------



### Part 1: Getting Started


Everyone has to start somewhere. If you're not a kid, it's a lot easier to get started if you compare to what you already know. Let's do that for a while. It's not as good as reading japanese, but it'll help a lot.


*(This guide assumes you know the kana, you're learning vocabulary, and you have a mouseover dictionary like Rikaisama (for Firefox) or Yomichan (for Chrome/Opera). If you don't, go fix that.)*



#### Lesson 1: State of being with だ and です


Japanese has two basic "is" words. The grammar term for "is" words is "copula". Copulas have a dedicated term because they're special.


The two copulas in japanese are だ and です. です is more polite than だ. Despite both being copulas, they can't always be used in the same patterns.


Unlike english, the state-of-being word goes **after** the word that you're using to describe something, rather than before it.


ペンだ  

It's a pen.  

  

ネコです  

It is a cat.
The difference between だ and です is sometimes translated as a difference in whether a contraction is used, but this is **not** what's happening in japanese.


Later on, we'll see です get used in places that english wouldn't allow "is". It can act like a filler word instead of a copula.


Japanese has two basic tenses: the simple tense and the simple past tense. Dictionaries list verbs by their simple tense. We're only using the word "simple" to say that nothing else is added to the verb.


The simple past form of だ is だった. The simple past form of です is でした.


オレだった！  

It was me!  

  

そうでした  

That was so.
The simple tense is usually called the present tense or the non-past tense. It's important to remember that it can be used in a lot of situations. Present tense and non-past tense are reasonable names, but don't treat names like rules, sometimes names are confusing. We'll be using these names interchangeably.


The simple tense and simple past tense usually line up with english's present and past tenses, but they're not used in all the same places. Just remember that english and japanese use tense in different ways.


In japanese, ordinary statements about the future use the simple tense most of the time. This is where the name "non-past" comes from.


The simple past tense is usually just called the past tense. Sometimes it can also be used for things that already completed like "has become", even if they're hypothetical and haven't happened yet.




#### Intermission: Vowels


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


Japanese only has five vowels. The quality of the vowels sometimes changes slightly depending on the sounds near them, but not enough to make new vowels.


Unlike english, japanese has a very regular orthography (how writing corresponds to sounds). The japanese vowels are, for our intents and purposes, always pronounced the same way, except for when they're not pronounced at all. More on that later.


Resources about the japanese vowel sounds are widespread on the internet. Explaining sounds through text is a fool's errand.




#### Lesson 2: Nouns, pronouns


Japanese has nouns and pronouns, just like english. Pronouns are less special than they are in english, and act like normal nouns most of the time.


Japanese does not have a plural form. Nouns and verbs don't have to agree for plurality, person, or gender. Japanese can explicitly refer to a group by attaching certain suffixes to nouns, but none of them are a true plural, they all convey extra information that plurals don't.


Japanese has tons of personal pronouns (me, you, them) that english doesn't, but the demonstrative pronoun system (this, that, these, those) is much less irregular. Also, japanese pronouns never change form for case like english ones do (he vs him), though you can put suffixes on them.


Don't bother memorizing these word lists. Learn words outside of this guide.


私・わたし me (normal, slightly formal when men use it)  

あたし me (casual, feminine)  

俺・おれ me (casual, masculine)  

僕・ぼく me (casual or polite, masculine)  

彼・かれ him  

彼女・かのじょ her / lady  

あなた you

達 is a suffix. This suffix can be applied to pronouns and nouns. This suffix refers to the group the noun/pronoun is in.


私達・わたしたち Us  

ジム達・じむたち Jim and company  

ペン達・ぺんたち The pen and stuff

達 is normally for living things, and the usage with "pen" above is considered colloquial, or at least informal. It just shows up enough to mention.


Japanese has compound words. They work the same way as in english.


町・まち town, district  

中・なか inside, middle  

町中・まちなか downtown, in town, the middle of town

Japanese has prefixes and suffixes just like english. This is different than compound words. Prefixes and suffixes can't stand on their own.


研究・けんきゅう research  

研究者・けんきゅうしゃ researcher

者, pronounced しゃ here, is a suffix. It can act like a piece of a compound word, but can't stand on its own as its own word. When 者 appears on its own in a sentence, it's a different word, and not pronounced as しゃ. *Thanks, kanji.*


昨日, meaning "yesterday", is normally read as きのう, not さくび. But since it's this guide's name, it can have a reading different than the normal word spelled the same way. Watch out for reading variation when you start reading, or you'll be super confused.




#### Intermission: Long vowels and gemination


*Intermissions are optional.*


In japanese, "long vowel" doesn't mean what it means when you're talking about english. Japanese long vowels literally last longer.


Japanese also has something called "gemination". Gemination means that the speaker briefly stops on a consonant. In japanese, this adds the same amount of time as using a long vowel. Practice the following to get a hang of the idea:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Kata | Ka-ta |
| Kaata | Ka-a-ta |
| Katta | Ka-t-ta |


The letter t isn't pronounced twice in the third example. There's a point in time when the mouth stops making the first "a" sound and is in the position of the "t" sound, but the air is blocked. It's not released until the "ta".


Long e is sometimes spelled as ei えい. Not all instances of えい are a long e. But all instances of えい that are a long e can also be pronounced as literally え followed by い. It can sound stiff, but it's still correct. To illustrate:


えい (not a long e): Only pronounced as えい  

えい (is a long e): Can be pronounced えい or ええ

Long o is sometimes spelled as ou おう. Not all instances of おう are a long o. Unlike えい, sequences of おう can only be pronounced a certain way, depending on whether it's a long o or not. おう is used this way because it reduces how many words have the same spelling.


おう (not a long o): Only pronounced おう  

おう (is a long o): Only pronounced おお

お and う are so close that the distinction between おう and おお might be hard to hear or articulate in casual speech, but the distinction is always *intended*.


Most instances of おう that are not long o sounds are verb endings. But there's one verb ending where this is not the case: the volitional, taught later.




#### Lesson 3: Particles and grammatical case


Japanese has "particles". Particles are similar to prepositions. They mark an entire phrase as having some logical relationship to something else. Japanese particles come after the phrase they're modifying instead of before it.


English uses word order when you need to know what job each noun has in a sentence: subject, verb, object. This can get flipped around in other patterns and in poetry, but word order is english's main thing here.


These jobs are called grammatical "cases", and each job is a particular "case".


Japanese uses particles to indicate these jobs. There's a default word order, and you can drop particles, but particles are the norm.


Remember: these translations are only for demonstration, and the japanese sentences are not necessarily natural-sounding. The sentences and translations are only here for illustration, not instruction.


ジムがネコを食べた  

じむが　ねこを　たべた  

Jim ate cat.
Here, が marks "Jim" as the subject. を marks ねこ as the direct object. The subject of a verb like "eat" is the person doing the eating.


Japanese throws a wrench into the picture by having something we call a "topic marker", は, which literally just says "this is what I'm talking about". Most grammar resources compare は to が. They do this because sometimes it's unnatural to use が, and you have to use は instead, or leave the subject unstated. But は is more general than being an alternative to が.


ネコはイヌが食べた The cat, a dog ate it.  

イヌはネコを食べた The dog ate a cat.

One way to differentiate は and が here is thinking of が as a focus marker. This "focus" is in **addition** to が's behavior as a subject marker, not instead of it.


ジムがネコを食べた Jim is the one that ate the cat.
English uses articles and swip-swappy sentence patterns for this kind of focus.


ネコは魚食べる  

Cats eat fish (cats in general)  

The cat eats fish (the cat we were talking about)  

  

ネコが魚食べる  

A cat eats fish (about a particular arbitrary cat)  

The cat eats fish (about a relevant cat)  

Cats are what eat fish (cats in particular)
Japanese is a "subject-object-verb" (SOV) language. That is, normal statements have subject, object, and verb in that order. English is SVO. Both languages allow moving the parts around, but doing so changes where the emphasis goes.


If you need more information on は, view ["Unit 8: Particle wa" of "Visualizing Japanese Grammar"](https://www2.gwu.edu/~eall/vjgnew/vjghomepage/vjghome.htm).




#### Intermission: Devoicing


*Intermissions are optional.*



In certain places, the vowels "u" and "i" can be "devoiced", meaning that they're not pronounced at all. です and でした are examples. It's still acceptable to pronounce the vowels in these cases, but you'll sound weird.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Desu | De-s |
| Deshita | De-sh-ta |


Don't bother learning any more about devoicing until you're much better at japanese. It'll make it harder to notice irregular devoicing patterns that people don't bother teaching.




#### Lesson 4: の means の: possession and attributes; bonus: honorifics


の is a particle. It's a possessive marker and an attributive marker. "Attributive" here means that something is an attribute of something else, like an attribute in a video game, like the "flame" in "flame sword". The relationship is always straightforward.


私のネコ My cat  

君の Yours.  

ネコの先 Ahead of the cat  

男の子 Boy (metaphorically, male child)
If you get lost, the easiest way to remember の is: It's like "of", but applies backwards.


夜の人 Person of the night
Sometimes "of" gets confusing, and you have to remember the idea "attribute".


夜の海 The night sea  

海の夜 Night on the sea (NOT "night of the sea")
の is literally the single most common word in all of japanese, so make sure you remember it well!


私の子供のネコが多い  

My child's cats are many. (My kid has a lot of cats.)
Let's take a moment to learn about honorifics. If you're consumed any translated japanese media, there's a good chance you already understand this.


When referring to another person by name, their name usually takes a suffix like さん, くん, さま, or ちゃん. This is not an exhaustive list of honorifics, and they have a lot of context-specific nuances that would take a long time to memorize. Just keep in mind their function.


Just like the honorific titles Mister, Miss, Master, Sir, and Lord in english, japanese honorifics indicate the attitude the speaker is taking towards that person, and/or towards their relationship with that person. It's much less normal to use the honorific alone in japanese than english, so they act more like suffixes than independent extra words.


Referring to someone by name without any honorific at all might be familiar or intimate, or assuming of your interpersonal relationship with them. This is extra true if you use their given name instead of their family name.




#### Intermission: Spelling irregularities


*Intermissions are optional.*


Japanese has a small number of spelling irregularities. These irregularities make written japanese easier to read, not harder.
Particles: When the particles は, を, and へ are spoken, they're pronounced as "wa", "o", and "e", not as "ha", "wo", or "he". Actually, "wo" is still correct, and you see it all the time in singing, but it sounds silly in normal speech.


Words: The word 言う いう, meaning "say", is pronounced ゆう when in the simple tense (dictionary form).


Japanese has a "pitch accent" system, where words have a specific change in pitch (or none) that distinguishes them. This is **not** the same thing as stress or tone.


Pitch accent is not represented when japanese is written in kana.


Pitch accent is actually very important if you want to speak, so [you're going to have to find a resource for that if you want one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_s6QqmJd7k).


Japanese isn't "robotic", "monotone", or "flat". Japanese has prosody, just like english. Every language has prosody. Prosody is the natural "musicalness" of language.








#### Lesson 5: Moving things with に, へ, and から


These particles mainly deal with location. から indicates the starting point of an action, and へ and に indicate the ending point of an action.


から is the same general "from" you see in english, even when it's abstract.


学校から私に家へ手紙を送った  

[He] sent me home a letter from school.
The english translation doesn't even have any marking on three of the nouns. Particles make things easier, at least for a language learner.


The subject was dropped in the japanese version of this sentence. The subject can be dropped in japanese if it's understood. This is just like how english uses pronouns. If you don't drop something that's obvious enough to drop, it emphasizes it.


へ translates well as "to" or "toward" in most situations, including abstract ones.


東京へ行く Going to Tokyo / Headed for Tokyo
に can mark an indirect object or a location.


An indirect object is something relevant to or affected by a verb, but not part of the verb's core meaning. This overlaps with へ a little, but へ cares more about motion and towardsness, and に cares more about the noun itself.


学校に来た Came to school.
Location is easy.


学校に暮らす I live in school.
The idea of "indirect object" used by に can show up in places that would look like direct objects in english.


研究者になる Becomes a researcher.  

ここに来た He came here.
In this way, に becomes a general "first option" for things that look like direct objects but cannot take を for the equivalent verb in japanese. There are other particles that also do this job, which we will cover later. For certain meanings, you can only use a given particle, not an arbitrary one.


These particles can be used in other ways, but we're not ready for that yet.


This is a good time to remember that particles attach to phrases, not words. This applies to every particle we've learned so far.


私の家から来た Came from my house


#### Intermission: Consonant irregularity


*Intermissions are optional.*


*The italic text in this intermission will indicate values in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Letters).*


The consonant g is sometimes pronounced ng, even at the beginning of words. In modern times, this is a matter of accent, not variation between dialects. It feels prestigious, not slangy, but it's being phased out.


The syllable ん is **always** pronounced as m before "p" and "b", **always** pronounced as ng (*ŋ*) before "k" and "g", and **always** pronounced like ng (*ɴ*) at the end of an utterance. Basically, it merges with whatever comes after it, just like how the "input" is usually pronounced "imput", and "inking" as "ingking".


Most japanese syllables use the consonants regularly. Only a couple don't.


Within the basic kana, only the kana ふ, つ, し, and ち have irregular consonant sounds. They are, in effect, "fu" (*ɸu*), "tsu", "shi" (*ɕi*), and "chi" (*t͡ɕi*), in order.


When they're voiced, three of the four irregular basic kana, づ, じ, and ぢ, change qualities slightly. So does ず.


In standard japanese, ず and づ are in free variation. Either one can be pronounced as dzu or zu.


The same is true with じ and ぢ pronounced as ji (*ʑi*) (as in the second consonant in "vision") or dji (*d͡ʑi*) (as in the first consonant in "James").


ず・づ and じ・ぢ being treated the same way is a feature of the standard accent. Other accents can merge the four of them together even more, or not merge them at all.


When し, ち, じ, and ぢ start diphthongs, like ちゃ, ぢゃ, しゃ, and じゃ, the "i/y" sound in the middle is dropped. For example, ちゃ is **always** pronounced as "cha" (*t͡ɕa*), never as "chya" (*t͡ɕja*). Normal diphthongs like きゃ are pronounced the normal way, like "kya" (*kja*).




#### Lesson 6: What is a verb? Nothing but a miserable pile of conjugations!


Unlike english, japanese has several categories of regular verbs. In other words, unlike english, japanese says that all of its verb categories are regular. Even though you might say that "ashen" and "eaten" are irregular in english, japanese doesn't follow the same logic.


Right now, japanese has two categories of regular verbs. It used to have categories of categories, but there's only two categories right now. The two categories are one-form verbs and five-form verbs, which conjugate differently.


Here's an example, using a ます form that we'll learn properly in Lesson 12. Don't bother memorizing this table.


見る／見ます, "one-form" verb.  

切る／切ります, "five-form" verb, ending in る.  

買う／買います, "five-form" verb, ending in う.  

死ぬ／死にます, "five form" verb, ending in ぬ.
One-form verbs always end in る, and just drop the る when they conjugate. The stuff leading up to that る is the verb's basic identity, and isn't changed. The verb itself, aside from conjugation, has only "one form".


Five form verbs can end in one of several syllables. In the present tense, this syllable always ends in a "u" vowel, and different conjugations can change it to any of the other four vowels in japanese, or slur it. This means that it can have any of five different vowels at the end. In other words, five forms.


Five-form verbs in the dictionary form can end in one of several different syllables, but it always ends in the vowel "u".


切る　殺す　死ぬ　選ぶ　読む　問う　動く　急ぐ　持つ

One-form verbs in the dictionary form always end in る. But the part before the る always ends in a phonetic "e" or "i". The dictionary form just attaches る to the one-form verb's *one and only base*, the part of the one-form verb that never changes.
Japanese verb conjugation likes to pile words together, and you end up with things like 見られたくなかった. Over the next few lessons, we start learning the logic behind these long piles of conjugations. This makes them easier to break down.


This lesson is just establishing the basics needed to understand what we're going to look at.








#### Intermission: "Synthetic" language


*Intermissions are optional.*


Japanese is synthetic. The linguistics term "synthetic" means that a language likes to synthesize (!) words out of small parts. Generally speaking. Above all, "synthetic" does **not** mean a manufactured, synthesized language itself.


Japanese is a synthetic language, due to it piling verb conjugations on top of eachother like 見られたくなかった. Piling things together like this is called "agglutinative". When you make complicated meanings with single pieces that have several implications, that's called "fusional". Japanese is not fusional.


The opposites of synthetic are "analytic" and "isolating". Chinese is both analytic and isolating. English is considered an analytic language because it loves function words and has relatively few productive inflections, but less isolating because it loves derivational affixes.


The exact definitions of "analytic" and "isolating" tend to be fuzzy, because extremely analytic or extremely isolating languages tend to be both, not just one or the other. Modern linguists think that categories like these, in the vague sense, aren't that useful at categorizing all the languages, just the ones that grammar people liked looking at.




#### Lesson 7: Negated verbs and using い-adjectives


When you turn a one-form verb into a negative verb, it cuts off the る at the end of the simple tense and adds ない.


For five-form verbs, you turn the ending "u" into an "a", with one exception.


These examples are for illustration. You should not memorize them, just understand them for now and move on.


1-form: Drop る, add ない  



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 見る | 見ない |
| 食べる | 食べない |




5-form: Replace "u" with "a", then add ない  



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 殺す | 殺さない |
| 切る | 切らない |
| 買う | 買わない |
| 問う | 問わない |



食べない not eating / to not eat
For five-form verbs ending in う, the negative uses わない, not あない. This is that one exception.


Japanese has two types of adjectives. Don't worry, it's not the same deal as the two categories of verbs. い-adjectives act like verbs. な-adjectives act like nouns. We'll cover な-adjectives later.


Here's an example of an い-adjective in practice.


赤い火 Red fire
The reason い-adjectives "act like verbs" is because you don't use だ with them.


火が赤いThe fire is red.
"is" is only present in the translation. In fact, attaching だ here would be ungrammatical. **Do not** attach だ to い-adjectives.


火が赤い*だ* (ungrammatical gargling)
Attaching です is okay, but です doesn't indicate state of being here, it just adds politeness. This is the first major way that だ and です are different. When it's not attached to a noun, です is just a politeness marker.


火が赤いです The fire is red.
There are more constructions that end up putting a だ or です right at the end of い-adjectives, but they don't indicate state of being like attaching だ or です to a noun does.


Like verbs, you can conjugate い-adjectives. Replace い with かった or くない.


火が赤かった The fire was red.  

火が赤くない The fire is not red.

ない is an い-adjective and you can conjugate it like one.


見なかった Did not see.


Adjectives are turned into abstract nouns with さ. There are more ways to do this, but さ is by far the most common.


大きさ Size (largeness) (from 大きい)




#### Intermission: What's subarashiki about poetry anyway?


*Intermissions are optional.*


In classical japanese, the attributive form of い-adjectives ended in き, not い, and き is therefore an adnominal form. You'll run into this form all the time since it's still intelligible to native speakers, so it's no use hiding it.


Japanese stories like to use literary language features once in a while, just like english. Just as a novel might misuse "wherefore", so too will a japanese novel misuse <confusing literary term X>. While this doesn't apply to the き ending of い-adjectives, it does apply to things too advanced to be covered here, for sure.


All the same, you're going to have to acquire the misused versions of literary terms in order to understand them when writers misuse them. That's part of the experience of the language, how <feature X> is used, not just what it's "supposed" to mean.


Uneducated attempts to sound archaic are definitely not 素晴らしき, but the low-grade tone of voice you can get out of just the right use of old grammar, or the jokes you can make when characters know different parts of it, those are definitely 素晴らしき.


Classical japanese actually has a couple different categories that evolved into modern い-adjectives, but you don't have to worry about that.




#### Lesson 8: The verb strikes back: the past tense


You form the past tense of a verb by attaching た or だ to the right "stem". Stems are basically the shortest verb forms you can write. You attach the right stuff to the end of the right stem when you want to make complex conjugations.


We're introducing stems now because the past tense of five-form verbs uses irregular stems.


90% of the time, you only use three stems. Here's an example:


殺す　死ぬ  

殺さ　死な  

殺し　死に/死ん

Here's an example of these stems in use:


殺す  

"he kills"  

殺さない  

"he doesn't kill"  

殺した  

"he killed"

That's right. Basic stuff like tense and negation uses only three stems. There are more stems, but they show up less often. We'll cover them later.


With that out of the way, we can introduce the past tense properly. We've seen the past tense forms of だ and です already, which are だった and でした. We also saw 殺した in the stem example above.


You'd be right to assume that the た is what makes it the past tense. The hard part, and the reason for the delay, is that the stem for the past tense of five-form verbs isn't as regular as the stem for the negative form. It depends on the exact original syllable ending. Here are all possibilities:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 切る | 殺す | 死ぬ | 選ぶ | 読む | 買う | 問う | 動く | 急ぐ | 持つ |
| 切った | 殺した | 死んだ | 選んだ | 読んだ | 買った | 問うた | 動いた | 急いだ | 持った |


Don't memorize this table. There's a rule for this, it's just irregular. Replace the "u" vowel with an "i" vowel, so you get like 切り, 死に, etc. Then attach the た, but slur it. The slurring is what makes it irregular. In particular, notice 死んだ and 急いだ.


Japanese speakers don't go through this process whenever they conjugate something. This process is like trivia to them. The "slurring" is a historic thing, and the slurred version is just what the form is now. At the very least, if you do a little reading and listening in japanese, you will be able to recognize the past tense at a glance. Exposure is more powerful than memorization.


The past tense of one-form verbs is easy. Replace the る with a た.


見る　見た  

食べる　食べた

We will learn another use of this stem, one where it's not slurred with five-form verbs, in Lesson 12.


Conjugation is more complicated than this, but take this one step at a time.


*(問う, 請う, and 恋う have irregular past conjugations among う-final five-form verbs. They might not be particularly common verbs, but they use a う stem for the past tense instead of the lengthened consonant. This is an example of the slurring being irregular.)*






#### Intermission: About jargon


*Intermissions are optional.*


First of all, a disclaimer: 問うた might not be used that often anymore. I was told 問いかけた is the normal way of saying it in speech, a phrasal verb. All the same, it's not hard to find 問うた.


The two categories of regular verbs have several english names, but only one japanese name each: 一段 and 五段. In english, they're called consonant or vowel stem verbs, ichidan or godan verbs, or "ru" and "u" verbs.


"ru" and "u" is the worst distinction. There are 五段 verbs that end in る.


"Consonant" vs "vowel" implies that the reader already understands how japanese conjugation works. It also implies that's the actual difference between the two categories, when in reality, there could be any number of consonant or vowel categories.


"One-form" and "five-form" what you get when you translate 一段 and 五段 in a way that makes sense in plain english. Translated formally, you get "monograde" and "pentagrade" (less common), and you see these words in scholarly writing. You find "monograde", "bigrade", and "quadrigrade" in writing about historical japanese.




#### Lesson 9: The て particle, the て form, and the imperative


Don't worry if this lesson seems hard. We're just covering fundamentals, you're not expected to internalize the ideas here yet.


There's a verb form that ends in て. This verb form is used in three main ways: to connect statements to eachother, to connect verbs to eachother, and as a simple command. We split this in two: the "て particle" and the "て form".


**The て "form"** is made by replacing the past tense's た with て. Keep in mind that this isn't some kind of secondary past tense.


殺して　切って　買って　死んで　食べて

The main use of the て form is the pattern **XてY**. This pattern uses Y to modify the meaning of X, and Y usually isn't literal.


The following two examples use てあげる and てもらう. We learn these for real near the end of this guide. They're kind of advanced, and you shouldn't try to understand them yet, just the **XてY** construction.


殺してあげる　I'm going to kill you.

In this example, the verb あげる attaches to the て "form" of 殺す. Normally, あげる means "raise something", but because it's used in this pattern, it means "give". The speaker is "giving" the action 殺す to someone else, probably you.


助けてもらう　roughly "is gratefully saved" or "receives help"  

save (te form) + receive

Here, the "receive" word, もらう, modifies 助ける's て form. This doesn't just emphasize how grateful they are for being saved. 助ける normally takes the savior as the subject, but the phrase 助けてもらう takes the survivor as the subject. The **XてY** pattern isn't just attaching the verb Y to an earlier statement, it makes a whole new verb phrase, with different grammar.


The て "form" of い-adjectives is Xい -> Xいで, so ない -> ないで. い-adjectives don't like the て "form" that much. You usually only see the て form of い-adjectives if the adjective is part of a verb conjugation, like ない.


食べないでください  

Please don't eat.
Here, 食べないで is the て "form" of 食べない, and ください is a "please" word that's attached to it.


The て "form" can make a simple command by using it alone. You can think of this like an implied ください for now.


食べて、少年 Eat, boy.  

見て！ Look!  

食べないで Please don't eat.
Now, **the "て particle"**. For verbs, the て "particle" and "form" are identical. For い-adjectives, you replace the い with くて.


食べなくて　赤くて

The main use of the て "particle" is to string statements together in a single sentence.


物分りがよくて助かる It'd help a lot to have a good understanding.  

彼女の目を見て、僕は告げる。 Looking her in the eyes, I say it.

In the first example, the statement 物分りがよくて is followed by the statement 助かる. 助かる is not modifying よくて. Instead, the first statement is setting up the context for the second statement.


The second example just strings the statements together the same way the translation does.


Sometimes the て "particle" lets a verb act as a topic. In this way, the て "particle" can look like a noun. It's not *really* a noun, it just looks like one in situations like this. *(To students of grammar: this is **not** a gerund, it just translates to a gerund here.)*


食べてはいい　It's good to eat.  

起きなくては　いけない　It's no good not to get up. ("Not getting up is no good.")
The て particle of ない, なくて, usually carries a "didn't X, so Y" nuance. But this is just a nuance. There's no literal indication of cause and effect here. It's just one of the possible nuances of なくて and some other uses of the て particle.


早く起きなくて　仕事に遅れた　I didn't get up early, and I was late for work. (reason)
This brings us to the fourth common verb stem, **the imperative** (commanding) form. This is a "true" imperative form, rather than the "simple command" made by using the て "form" alone. Basically, the imperative form usually sounds rude.


The imperative of one-form verbs is ろ, and the imperative of five-form verbs replaces the u with an e.


死にながら見ろ  

Look as I die  

  

殺せ Kill them!  

切れ  

買え
There's an alternative imperative for one-form verbs, but you can ignore it until you're adept. Just remember that it exists.


食べよ Eat!


#### Intermission: What even is an infinitive?


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them. Especially this one.*


In the grammar taught in schools, english speakers are usually taught that verbs like "to go" are infinitives, without being given a good explanation about what that means or why they're called that.


In the study of latin, verb forms could be categorized based on whether they contained information about subject, and these categories were obvious, because latin verbs have to agree with their subject's gender, just like they can with number/person in english (I go, you go, he goes).


However, some verb forms in latin contain literally no information about the subject. Such verbs are called "non-finite", because they didn't "finish up" (see: FINIte) the information necessary to make a real statement with the verb. Infinitive is the most non-finite a verb can be.


This concept is hard to explain when you move away from "fusional" languages like latin, because you stop containing so much extra information in the verb forms, and you even end up with subtle overlap between infinitives and gerunds.


There's light on the other end of the tunnel. The main use of infinitives in english is to link verbs with words that *do* have a "finite"ness to them.


"I want to go now."  

"It's not that he's going to be late, he just doesn't know what to do".
Here, "to go", "to be late", and "to do" are (respectively) clearly attached to "want", "going", and "what". The rule isn't as simple as "stick two verbs together", and the same is true with japanese's て "form" and the stem the て "form" attaches to.


However, because japanese is a topic-prominent language **and** has no fusion, the concept of "finite"ness is even harder to understand against it than english. Linguisticians are working hard at problems like this and have a lot of really good ideas, but they're unintelligible to normal language learners.


Because of this, as well as the fact that linking an abstract verb to a less abstract verb is *not* their only use, the て "form" and its stem won't be called infinitives in this guide. But the comparison to infinitives is glossed over almost everywhere, so I thought I should point it out for the two of you that actually understand infinitives.




#### Lesson 10: Being more with で, では, and じゃ


Normally, で marks the "circumstance" or "means" behind an action. Circumstance can be a location.


剣で出来ている  

Is made out of swords  

  

刀で殺した  

Killed (others) with a katana  

  

バスで来た  

Came by bus  

  

学校で働く  

Working at school
で comes from contracting にて. You see にて in old fashioned writing.


で can also be used like it's the て "particle" of だ. It's not **actually** the て "particle" of だ, but it's close enough for japanese grammar to say it is.


私は彼が本当に犬で慌てる  

He's really a dog and I'm flustered.  

(I'm flustered that he's really a dog.)
This brings us to では. では is a compound particle. The は here is the topic marker, but では's meaning isn't defined as the sum of its parts. では marks the circumstance or condition of another state.


公園ではアイスが売られる  

Ice cream is sold at the park.
This extends to state of being.


私は学生ではない  

I am not a student.
The conversational version of the above uses じゃ, a contraction of では.


私は学生じゃない  

I'm not a student.
Because it's not contracted, ではない is a low grade formal negative assertion. In fact, じゃない is basically the negative version of だ. The etymology of だ has で in it, but we'll learn that etymology later.


Some dialects have different normal spoken copulas than だ. Examples are や and じゃ. This じゃ is a contraction of something other than では. では is not a copula.


ペンじゃ  

'ts a pen. (it's a pen.)


#### Intermission: Japanese japanese grammar is bad, too, actually


*Intermissions are optional.*


In japanese school grammar, で is considered the て "particle" of だ. (Well, they don't distinguish the て form and て particle, but same difference.) This is because of the way it can act like a conjunction. Make sure not to confuse the words "conjugation" and "conjunction".

It's confusing when you learn the etymology of だ, because you end up with a system where で and だ are derived from eachother with に caught in the crossfire.


ツインテールになりました  

I became twintails.  

  

本当にツインテールで嬉しい  

(Garbled dysfluent otaku noises)
The easiest way to think of things is that they lead back to に and て, not だ. But it's important to remember that japanese school grammar still considers で to be the て "particle" of だ, because it's allowed to act like it is.


This is one of the reasons I presented the て "particle" and て "form" as different things.


Some instances of にて might actually be a fossilized proto-japanese copula, not a combination of the に and て particles, but it basically merged with the case particle sequence にて at some point, and both interpretations are valid. This "fossilized proto-japanese copula" is basically treated as the reason why で is allowed to "act like the て particle of だ" sometimes.




#### Lesson 11: Getting detailed with relative clauses and な-adjectives


*In grammar, a "clause" is a phrase that contains a single statement. "It's already over" is a clause. The "I'm late" in "I'm sorry I'm late" is a clause. Compound sentences, like "I'm late because the traffic was bad", contain multiple clauses.*


Relative clauses are statements that are somehow embedded inside another statement. We're going to cover relative clauses that modify nouns. Relative clauses that modify nouns act like "the house *I used to live in*".


To make a verb modify a noun directly, you just attach the verb to the front of the noun. This means that japanese verbs basically act like adjectives. Adjectives can also be used in relative clauses, even with a subject.


食べる人  

Person that eats  

  

私にくれる人  

People that give to me
The simple tense of だ can't make a relative clause, but its past tense can.


必要だ物です  

(ungrammatical frothing)  

  

好きだった食べ物  

Food that I liked
In rare circumstances, that rule can be broken, but it's a real rule, not a fake one. Don't make relative clauses with just だ.


In relative clauses, の is allowed to mark the subject instead of が, even if you leave out the noun that the relative clause is modifying.


君の来た場所 The place you came  

全く光のない Totally without light ("where light totally is not")
Now let's look at な-adjectives, named after the な that comes after them.


バカな子供  

Stupid kid  

  

大好きな人  

Dearly beloved person
な-adjectives act like nouns if you don't attach the な.


君が好きだ  

I like you.  

(You are liked.)
な acts like a suffix for な-adjectives that makes a relative clause. な can even be used this way on a lot of normal nouns, not just な-adjectives. But な-adjectives are special, and dictionaries have different categories for nouns and な-adjectives. Some な-adjectives aren't "normal" nouns. It's weird if you use them as a noun in the wrong place.


の-adjectives are nouns that are special because they turn into full-blown adjectives when の is attached, instead of turning into a general attribute or a possessive. This is different than な-adjectives which are always special.


英語の本  

English-language books. (NOT "books of english")
*(To students of grammar: this use of の is a full blown genitive case. The normal use of の with nouns for attribution and possession is similar to the genitive, but distinct, especially because japanese has の-adjectives.)*




#### Intermission: The dreaded parse and auxiliary verbs


*Intermissions are optional.*


When relative clauses come together in a sufficiently complex way, "parsing", or selecting the right relationship between words, gets increasingly complex. In all languages, the *correct parse* is selected with a combination of common sense and how common the possible patterns are.


Here's a popular meme about this exact phenomenon.


顔が赤い魚を食べた猫  

  

(顔が赤い)(魚を食べた)猫  

The cat that ate a fish and the cat had a red head.  

  

((顔が赤い)魚)を食べた猫  

The cat that ate a fish and the fish had a red head.  

  

(顔が(赤い魚)を食べた)猫  

The cat whose head ate a red fish.  

  

顔が((赤い魚)を食べた猫)  

The head is a cat that ate a red fish.  

  

顔が赤い((魚を食べた)猫)  

The head is a red cat that ate a fish.
Coming up in the next lesson, an auxiliary verb is a verb that attaches to another verb and gives meaning to that verb instead of having its own meaning.


Normal verbs like いる sometimes act as auxiliary verbs. Japanese japanese grammar distinguishes between auxiliary verbs that can **either** act normally **or** as auxiliaries, and auxiliary verbs that must **only** act as auxiliaries. So いる is sometimes called a "subsidiary" verb instead of auxiliary, even in english. In this guide we'll call them auxiliary when they're used that way, instead of treating "auxiliary verb" like a part of speech.




#### Lesson 12: Irregular verbs and basic formality


Now that we've covered the most common verb stems, we can cover the irregular verbs. Japanese only has two blatant irregular verbs, but they're very common. Their conjugations are completely irregular.


する, meaning "do"  

来る くる, meaning "come"  

  

する した しない せよ  

くる　きた　こない　こい
The irregular imperatives are so irregular that casual spoken japanese sometimes uses completely different imperatives altogether. They're not formally correct, but you'll run into them anyway.


しろ・くれ
Many more verbs have one or two irregular conjugations, but する and くる take the cake and are the most important to know about for reading.


Let's cover basic formality while we're at it. Basic polite verbs use an auxiliary verb, ます, attached to a stem. For one-form verbs, ます attaches to the One True Base. For five-form verbs, change the u to an i, then attach ます.


食べます (Someone) eats/will eat.  

行きますよ I'm heading out!  

切ります Cuts [something] (polite)
Warning: don't attach ます to です, it doesn't work.


In lesson 8, we mentioned that the five-form past tense comes from this "i" stem. That version is "reduced". Let's review.


死んだ　shi n da  

死にます　shi ni ma su  

殺した　koro sh ta  

殺します　koro shi ma su
Notice that the "i" is not pronounced in 殺した. You can pronounce it, but it'll sound weird. 死んだ removes the "i" completely, even in spelling. Also, the ん in 死んだ causes the た to become "voiced", た to だ, the same thing that turned にて into で.


Here's a comparison between the past tense and ます form of each type of five-form verb. Don't memorize this.




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 切る | 殺す | 死ぬ | 選ぶ | 読む | 買う | 問う | 動く | 急ぐ | 持つ |
| 切ります | 殺します | 死にます | 選びます | 読みます | 買います | 問います | 動きます | 急ぎます | 持ちます |
| 切った | 殺した | 死んだ | 選んだ | 読んだ | 買った | 問うた | 動いた | 急いだ | 持った |


And these are the basic conjugations of ます.


死にます　死にました　死にません　死にませんでした
ません doesn't have a past tense of its own. To use the past tense with ません, you attach でした, the past tense of です.




#### Intermission: Keigo and some archaic speech


*Intermissions are optional.*


Keigo is a prescribed way of using japanese that encodes information about respect, humility, and politeness. Some of the politeness mechanisms of normal japanese (like ます and です) overlap with keigo, but keigo goes beyond that.


Keigo makes strict distinctions between politeness, respectfulness, and humility, and also adds mechanisms for "word beautification". We'll cover the normal ways to do some of this later on, but keigo is a level above what the normal language does.


In keigo, certain phrases act as alternatives to normal words, and they have different levels of respectfulness, humility, politeness, beauty, etc. Because this is prescribed, not all japanese speakers understand it 100%, but everyone's aware of the basics and the fact that it exists.


These phrases basically act like euphemisms for normal words. These phrases are usually longer than what they replace (since longer = more formal), and since they're basically euphemisms, they're kind of nonliteral/indirect. If you know that keigo exists, you'll be less confused when you run into them.


Here's an example of the keigo versions of the word する "do":


なさる (respectful)　いたす (humble)　します (polite)
Keigo cares about your social status compared to other people, which is why there's several categories and why it's prescribed.


Keigo is basically a register of speech. Just like someone living in a slum would be totally out of touch with the way the language used in a cathedral, someone who learned japanese playing video games would be mostly out of touch if they ended up in a business meeting. Of course, a game will probably use keigo, but not in the right ways for you to acquire it.


On the subject of registers of speech, you will occasionally run into things like よりて where よって normally goes, using the unreduced version of the stem described in Lesson 12, but this is basically exclusive to intentionally archaic writing.





### Part 2: Rest


Let's relax and do easier stuff before we head out into the real world. Before we start fighting monsters. Before The Gauntlet.



#### Lesson 13: Questions with か and の, featuring のだ


Questions in japanese are usually formed with tone of voice, or with か, or with の. This covers yes/no questions. We'll cover "wh"-questions later.


When a writer has a character ask a question with just tone of voice, they usually use a ？, but otherwise, the ？ is not needed. Japanese doesn't have the same writing rules as english.


熱い？ Is it hot?
When a question is formed with か, the か just goes at the end of the sentence. If the sentence ended with だ (the copula), the だ is removed. There's no special reason for this rule, in fact it can be ignored in archaic writing, it just makes the language simpler.
お前は警察か Are you with the police?  

熱いか Is it hot?  

知るか？ Do you know?
To frame a question politely, you can use ですか or ますか. ますか is only used with verbs, and it's just the question marker か stuck to a polite verb. ですか attaches to the question you want to ask as a whole, even if it ended with a verb or い-adjective.


彼は学生ですか。 Is he a student?  

古いですか Is it old?  

来るですか Is it coming?  

食べますか Won't you eat?
Sometimes か forms things that look like rhetorical questions, since they're not really looking for an answer. But they're not actually rhetorical, because they're not trying to make a point. Every language does this.


あら、そうか。 Oh, is that so.
I'm not saying that か can't be used for rhetorical questions. It can. It's just that this kind of question isn't necessarily rhetorical.


の acts just like か, except that for nouns, you replace だ with な instead of deleting だ. This is the same な from な-adjectives.


普通なの Is it normal?  

食べないの？ Won't you eat?  

どうしたの What's wrong?
Answering a の-questions usually uses a のだ-statement or a の-statement. This kind of statement can also stand alone, as a kind of non-comprehensive reason or explanation of something. のだ can be pronounced んだ.


食べたくないのよ I don't really want to eat. (That's why I'm not eating.)  

遅いんだ I'm late. (I gotta hurry.)  

何してるのだ What are you doing?  

何をしてんだ What're you doing?
のだ isn't used when the speaker is merely making a statement. Also, のだ is sometimes a question, but it's rare, and it's always obvious when it is.








#### Intermission: Two notes on の and のだ


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


When の stands alone at the end of a の-statement, it sounds feminine or cute.


のだ is the etymology of の-statements and の-questions.




#### Lesson 14: Why, cruel world? なぜ なんで どうして


なぜ, なんで, and どうして mean "why". They can also be used the same way as "how". "Tone of voice" questions with these words don't need a ？.


Generally, the longer something is, the more polite it is, but in **very** formal situations you can use the short things again. This works here, too. どうして is the most polite, なんで is neutral, and なぜ is the most simple.


なんで来ません So, why won't he come?  

どうして遅いの？ Why is it late?  

なぜだろう I wonder why. (not sarcastic)
These words are used in different places by different people in different registers of speech. Sometimes one is more frequent than another in a certain phrase, but there's no real pattern. なぜ can sound rude in conversation.




#### Intermission: Notes on なぜ なんで どうして


*Intermissions are optional.*


The なん in なんで corresponds to 何 なに, a word meaning "what".


どうして looks a lot like どうした from an example in the last lesson. That's because it is. どうして is the て "form" of the phrase, and た is the past tense of it.




#### Lesson 15: Getting more with も and と


も is an inclusion marker. You can think of it like "too" or "also" for now.


When も marks something marked by は, が, or を, that particle is dropped.


私も行く I'll go, too (in addition to other people)  

魚も食べたい I want to eat fish too (in addition to something else)  

今日も元気だな You're lively today too, huh. (in addition to another day)
も can be used with negative statements. Normally, it includes the given noun in the set of things that the negative statement is true for. But sometimes it does weird things because negation changes how logical inclusion/exclusion works. We'll cover this in more detail much later, but keep it in mind.


僕も食べない I won't eat, either. (in addition to other people)
と also "includes", but it doesn't "include" on the grammatical level も does.


と normally makes a list of things.


ジムとサトシは来ない Jim and Satoshi won't come.
と sometimes marks a kind of indirect object. Then it acts like "with". This is not the same "with" that で means when it marks "circumstance/means".


私はヤンと勉強しない I don't study with Yan.


#### Intermission: Single piece of trivia on と


*Intermissions are optional.*


The manga よつばと！ stylizes its title as "YOTSUBA&!", with an ampersand.




#### Lesson 16: Existence with いる and ある, finding である and っす


The verbs いる and ある express existence. The difference between the two isn't politeness, it's "animatedness". An animal or person takes いる, but a table or sandwich takes ある. Something like a patrol car, which exists to move but isn't alive, can use one or the other depending on context.


家には猫がいる In the house there lives a cat.  

店がある There are stores.
The above is only a general guideline. Certain uses are interchangeable, but using the wrong existence verb in the wrong phrase will sound unnatural. Picking the unnatural one usually indicates a nuance.


なぜこんなに店がいる Why are there shops like this?
The above is a real phrase that someone wrote, and the choice of いる instead of ある changes the flavor of their frustration. ある would be normal here.


Sometimes, when people want to explain that they have something, they use ある or いる. ある and いる don't mean "have", it's just a wording difference.


デスクがある There's a desk / I have a desk  

私の家には猫がいる I have a cat.
いる conjugates as a one-form verb.


ある conjugates as a five-form verb, but its negative conjugation is irregular.


ある ない あった あります ありません  

  

店がない There is no store.
Now that we know ある, we can bring up the etymology of だ, which is である. である is a very formal "to be" word derived from にてあり. Unlike だ and です, である can be used with relative clauses attached to nouns.


You might remember that we used ではない to derive the negative of だ, じゃない. ではない is basically である's negative.


である　であった　ではない
*(Warning: であった is identical to 出会った written in kana, another verb's past tense.)*


Usually, the topic particle は is inserted between で and ない here. However, you **do** sometimes run into でない, especially in entertainment media.


Finally, we come to っす, a slurred version of です used in casual speech. It's less formal than です, but serves the same grammatical roles. There's a stereotype of it being used by girls and young women.


いいです -> いいっす  

犬ですか -> 犬っすか
っす is also sometimes used to contract ございます, a keigo version of ある. Again, removing the formality from it, but keeping the politeness.


おはようございます -> おはようっす -> おっす (yes, really)


#### Intermission: Notes on いる, ある, である, and っす


*Intermissions are optional.*


要る いる "need" is a different word than いる "exist" and conjugates differently.


ある used to have "real" negative forms (あらず, あらぬ), but they have been entirely replaced with ない. This is the same process that gave us go -> went in english.


Note that some dialects of japanese sometimes use あらへん as a negative of ある, and you will definitely run into あらへん in entertainment media. へん can substitute for ない in general in these dialects.


ある's imperative is あれ, but it's not really used that often, and it conflicts with an unrelated word we haven't introduced yet.


である is appropriate for ceremonies, archaic things, and pretentious things. If someone starts rolling off tons of である, they're not being formal, they're being histrionic. であります is even better.


The etymology of です itself is not known, but the two leading ideas (at the time of writing) are that it's a contraction of でございます or であります.




#### Lesson 17: Enduring the pain of ている and てある


This brings us to ている and てある, which use いる/ある as auxiliary verbs.
ている indicates an enduring action/state. For most verbs, this means progressive or continuous (enduring action), but for others, it means the complete state of the action remains (enduring state). The second kind of verb is usually "intransitive", meaning that they cannot normally accept a direct object, like 死ぬ "die".


食べている I'm eating. (enduring action)  

死んでいる He's dead. (enduring state)
The い in ている can be dropped. This is normal but not formal.


食べてる I'm eating.
てある is about something being in an enduring state resulting from an action. It's important to remember that てある expresses a state, not an action.


ケーキ作ってあるよ The cake's done! (Someone has made the cake.)
てある takes the direct object and treats it as a subject. This means that the verb's normal "logical object" is usually marked with が or は or unmarked, like the cake in the example above. But because japanese is linguistically weird, sometimes を is used, too. You can think of using を here like taking the entire phrase "<thing>を作る" and conjugating that phrase with てある.


Finally, it expresses a state, not an action, so てある is not "the passive". Japanese has a real passive that we'll cover soon.


Normally, intransitive verbs plus ている act alike transitive verbs plus てある, aside from using the logical subject instead of the logical object. This is what "enduring state" means for ている.


ている only shows up for い-adjectives when the い-adjective is the end of a verb phrase, like 食べないでいる. This is the て "form" of the verb phrase 食べない. You can't do this with い-adjectives on their own.


Something like なくている is nonsensical because the くて form of い-adjectives is always a conjunction, never a way to string words together. Remember not to confuse the words "conjugation" and "conjunction".








#### Intermission: Notes on ている and てある


*Intermissions are optional.*


Progressive ている can also be something that happens on a regular basis, not just at the moment. Like "I go to a highschool".


を with てある is the first of many brainfucky constructions that really mess with western conceptions of subject, object, etc. No grammar instruction will help you understand more than if you did a little reading. Read, read, and read more.


The closest thing to てある for い-adjectives is くある, which is only used in constructions that want to work on the adjective like a verb like 悪くあります, and is wrong or unnatural on its own like in 悪くある. A couple adverb-based constructions like 多くある overlap with this くある, but they're different. You will definitely run into things like 悪くあります, but this is a way of making polite verbal statements with adjectives, not expressing an enduring state.




#### Lesson 18: Demonstrating: これ, それ, あれ, どれ, and friends


These words are called demonstratives. Demonstratives are words that mean things like "this", "that", etc.


Japanese is different than english on this front in two ways. First, its demonstratives are much more regular, and second, it has demonstratives point at three "locations" instead of two.


これ this thing  

それ that thing (near you　/ over there)  

あれ that thing (over there / over yonder) (distant)  

どれ which thing

コレはいいですか Is this good?
The above four words are "demonstrative pronouns". There's two pronouns that translate into english as "that", but they reference different places. それ is for things that are near the "second person" instead of just away from the "first person". あれ is for things that aren't close to either person.


Again, aside from "that" being split into two categories, they're very similar to english. Physical distance is just a useful reference about how they're different, not a deciding factor about how they're used.


The demonstrative "determiners" just use good old の. A determiner *determines* a particular thing or group of things.


この this X  

その that X  

あの that X (distant)  

どの which X  

  

このバカが...! This idiot...!
There are also "sorts", locations, etc. The あ series is a little irregular, but the か and さ series are regular.


ここ here (this place)  

こちら/こっち this way (towards here)  

こんな this sort of X  

こう like this  

そう like that  

あそこ over there (distant)  

ああ like that (distant)
There are a couple demonstrative personal pronouns as well, but the meanings of the most common ones look a little irregular. These are the common ones.


こいつ this guy  

そいつ that guy  

あいつ that guy (distant)  

あなた you (yep, this is a demonstrative)
Literal physical distance is not the determining factor for which personal pronoun is used in a given situation, common use is.


どいつ exists but it's mostly only used in grammatical constructions.




#### Intermission: Notes on demonstratives


*Intermissions are optional.*


The "like so" determiners are parallel to よう, but よう isn't part of a demonstrative category. It means just some particular "kind".


There's an irregular demonstrative determiner, かの. かの is used for things that are known to the first and second person, but are distant in a very abstract way. かの is essentially unused outside of very formal or literary uses. Also, the pronoun for "he", かれ, used to be かの's demonstrative pronoun. かの is very literary and you're only likely to encounter it used for literary effect.





### Part 3: The Gauntlet


Some things you just have to get out of the way before you can go on.


Even if they're annoying.



#### Lesson 19: Passive られる・あれる and so-called "transitive pairs"


Passive verbs exist to turn the logical object of a verb into the grammatical subject. Unlike てある, passives describe the action, rather than making a statement about an enduring state left by that action.


Five-form and one-form verbs form the passive in different ways. Five-form verbs take the negative stem and replace ない with れる, the passive suffix. One-form verbs take the *one and only base* and add ら, \*then\* add れる. Basically, for regular verbs, you replace the last u with an a and add れる, unlike negatives where one-form verbs drop the る entirely instead of just the u.


食べられる  

殺される  

  

殺された人間の死体 The dead bodies of people who were killed.  

魚が食べられた The fish got eaten.
The person who logically performs an action is called the "agent". If you want to state the agent of a passive verb, you usually use に, but for certain phrases, から is also acceptable. This calls back to に being a general fallback for the secondary arguments of a verb.


魚が猫に食べられた The fish was eaten by a cat.
In grammar study, there's a concept of verbal "transitivity", which basically just has to do with whether the verb accepts a normal direct object or not. We already learned that "intransitive" verbs describe a state if you attach ている.


彼を教えた I taught him. (transitive)  

彼が死ぬ He dies. (intransitive)
"Transitive pairs" are pairs of japanese verbs that represent the same action, but one is transitive, and the other is not. Unlike passives, intransitive verbs in a "transitive pair" don't usually accept marking an agent with に.


上げる to raise something  

上がる for something to rise  

  

見る to see  

見える for something to be seen/visible


#### Intermission: Notes on the passive


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


Sometimes から is used for the agent of a passive verb. This shows a difference in nuance. から is sometimes unacceptable.


Keigo loves passives. You're on your own here.


Adjectives are inherently intransitive and stateful. This even applies to ones that *look* logically transitive, like 好き.


English has a couple transitive pairs, like raise/rise and lay/lie, but modern spoken english is trying to merge these together, since modern spoken english doesn't care that much about transitivity anymore (I blew up the car vs The car blew up). This merge is not happening in japanese.




#### Lesson 20: Potential れる・える and できる


The potential form exists so that people can say that something "can be done". For five-form verbs, the u is replaced with an e, then added る. So "u" -> "eru". For one-form verbs, it's identical to the passive. Do you hate one-form verbs yet?


食べられる  

食べれる (!)  

殺せる  

死ねる  

ありえる
To explain what's going on here, I have to dump some **really** annoying information on you, so sorry not sorry. Don't worry if your eyes gloss over trying to read it, that's normal. Just read it and move on.


The long form for one-form verbs, 食べられる is the "correct" way to make a potential one-form verb. However, the short form, 食べれる, shows up all the time colloquially, and has done so for a long time, both because it's more regular with five-form verbs and because the long form is obviously ambiguous.


Unfortunately, if context doesn't make it obvious, gut feeling is the only way to know whether a given appearance of one-form られる is passive or potential or both.


In addition to the one-form's ambiguity problem, every passive form can mean the potential sometimes. It's up to you to figure out whether a given use of the passive means a passive, a passive-potential, or just a potential.


*A million eyes gloss over in annoyance.*


ありえる is irregular and is always potential.


Now we can talk about 出来る できる, a one-form verb that means "made" or "completed". It does double duty as する's potential.


出来る 出来ない 出来た 出来ます  

  

昨日は勉強できなかった Yesterday I couldn't study.  

  

できません I can't.  

*(In english, "can not" and "cannot" are assertive in speech. できません isn't, so the contraction is appropriate despite ます)*

私は日本語出来ない (unintelligible dysfluent gagging)


#### Intermission: Notes on the potential


*Intermissions are optional.*


Traditional japanese grammar says that the passive and potential are blurry in general, even for five-form verbs, but it's only a matter of time before they're not. A doubled-up form, as in 食べれられる, is already in very common colloquial use. I've been told it's feminine.


In any case, if you see one of the five-form potentials or the one-form short potential, you can be 99.9999% sure it doesn't mean the passive.


The short potential is sometimes homophonous with an existing strictly "passive" intransitive verb that comes from the same root transitive word, like 切れる. In these cases, you just have to stay frosty.


The five-form verbs' potential form might come from the stem used with the polite (ます) form, plus 得る える, a verb that normally means "get" but here means "is possible". The -ie sequence would contract to -e, except for ありえる.


As a side note, the five-form -eru potentials predate the one-form short potential, which is probably why they're more accepted.




#### Lesson 21: Wanting with おう/よう, たい, and ほしい


In this section, we're learning three of the ways that japanese expresses desire.


The "volitional" form, おう/よう, says that you want to or will do something, or invites volition in other people like "let's X". It's also used in compound constructions about volitional action. The volitional form of five-form verbs is -ou, and the volitional form of one-form verbs is よう. It's pronounced with a "long o", not お plus う.


行こう Let's head out.  

行こうか How about we go?  

食べようと思う I think I'll eat.
With copulas, it usually "invites an idea", like conjecture or possibility.


いいでしょう It's good, don't you think? (おう form of です)  

犬だろうと、猫だろうと、なんでも問題ありません Perhaps dogs, perhaps cats; whatever way, there's no problem. (*おう form of だ, contraction of であろう*)
The second way to express desire is たい. たい is an い-adjective that attaches the same way as ます. Like てある, たい turns the phrase intransitive.


死にたい I want to die.  

アイスが食べたい I want to eat icecream.  

(metaphorically "icecream is wanted to be eaten")
Despite making the verb become intransitive, spoken japanese can use を with たい. This is sometimes considered incorrect, but it doesn't feel wrong. The one that logically wants to do the action can't be marked with を.


昨日は君がタイヤキを食べたいと思う I thought yesterday you wanted taiyaki.  

(metaphorically "yesterday, you were wanting to eat taiyaki")
たい can go at the end of entire phrases that retain their full internal structure. This applies to a lot of other verb forms too, like てある, but たい is hard enough that this should be pointed out directly.


The final way of wanting is 欲しい ほしい, an い-adjective meaning "wanted".


アイスがほしい I want ice cream (metaphorically "ice cream is wanted")
ほしい is also used as an auxiliary adjective (just like an auxiliary verb) meaning that you want something to happen. If you include the agent that you want to do the thing, you usually mark it with に.


あなたに英語を教えてほしい I want you to teach me english.
てほしい can also be used like the below example. This isn't the only situation where が can be used with てほしい.


じゃあ今、私が何してほしいかわかる？  

Well then, understand what I want you to do now?
Be careful to make sure that the が is actually marking the first person in cases like that. In the following example, が marks the subject of a relative clause, not the subject of the main verb with ほしい on it.


そなたが見た事を伝えてほしい  

I want you to convey what you saw on your end. (crappy translation)
Supposedly, が can mark the agent of the desired action in more situations than this, but I haven't found any examples.




#### Intermission: Notes on wanting


*Intermissions are optional.*


The volitional form おう/よう comes from a sound change from "au" (as in the sound a, followed by the sound u) to "ou" (as in a long o). The original form was e.g. 見やう and 死なう, but remember that classical japanese verbal conjugation is **very** different than what it is today.


As such, the お in the five-form base used to actually be an あ, meaning that the five-form verbs were four-form verbs. You see "yodan" in some english grammar writing about japanese because of this. But they have been called "godan", five-form, for a very long time. Normal japanese people are not taught the term yodan anymore.


About たい. 見たい みたい mean "seems", not just "wants to look". No matter what grammar you're looking at, some expressions work outside the normal rules. It's vital for you to think about what things mean in context, not just what their parts imply. In the case of みたい, the "seems" meaning is usually in kana and follows a verb, but not every exception is predictable like みたい.


死んだみたい Looks like he died


#### Lesson 22: One way of saying "if" with ば


Verbs have a ば form that turns them into a condition. The conjugation turns the u at the end of a verb into an e, then adds ば. Basically, for five-form verbs, you replace the u with an e, and for one-form verbs, you add れ after the *one and only base*.


見れば死ぬ If I look I'll die.  

殺せばいいかなぁ I suppose it would be fine if I killed him.
ば implies that the condition is sufficient for and implies its result, a logical "if". This can even be used for certain requests, like "If you're late, just call and I'll handle everything".


ば doesn't imply that the condition will happen, so it won't be used in things like "When you come around, come see me". We'll see other conjunctions that're appropriate for that later.




#### Intermission: The Gauntlet


*Intermissions are optional.*


This is the last intermission. You've almost made it through the gauntlet. After the next lesson, you're through. Keep it up.


For a piece of trivia, ば comes from the topic marker, は. The h- syllables used to be pronounced with a p, which is why their voiced versions use a b. The topic marker is an edge case where a p evolved into a w instead of an h.




#### Lesson 23: Verbs review


We've finally run into all of the basic stems of the five-form verbs, so this is a good time to review what we've learned. Please don't try to memorize this. Knowing that these ideas exist is enough. If your eyes gloss over, relax. If you can't do it, move on.


The names given on the left are plain english representations of the japanese names. Where needed, the japanese names have alternative translations. If a form/base/stem is referred to in the rest of the guide, I'll use the plain english name, not the japanese name.


死な "none such" form ("as if it has not yet happened" 未然形)  

死の tentative form   

死に verb-sticky form (連用形)  

死ん verb-sticky form (連用形) (reduced)  

死ぬ terminal form (終止形)  

死ね "some such" form ("as if it were so" 已然形 / "hypothetical" 仮定形)  

死ね imperative form (命令形)
If you count, you'll identify that the base stem "shi-n" (which ends on a consonant) inflects to each of the five japanese vowels. This is what "five-form" means.


Four-form, or 四段 "yodan", shows up regularly in english writing on japanese grammar, but japanese natives literally aren't even taught the word anymore.


One-form verbs look like so:


食べ "none such" form ("as if it has not yet happened" 未然形)  

食べ tentative form \*  

食べ verb-sticky form (連用形)  

食べる terminal form (終止形)  

食べれ "some such" form ("as if it were so" 已然形 / "hypothetical" 仮定形)  

食べろ imperative form (命令形)
*\* The よ isn't part of this base. 食べよ alone is an alternative imperative.*


As you can see, there's a lot more irregularity here, but the verb's base kana stem never changes, hence the name one-form. The *one and only base*.


This is the set of classical bases, aside from modernization: including the reduced verb-sticky form and the tentative, and excluding the attributive.


The "none such" form is used for negatives, passives, and some condition expressions. It's also the etymology of the tentative form.


The tentative form is the base of the volitional/hortative ～おう/よう forms.


The terminal form is, for normal dictionary verbs, the plain "non-past" tense.


The verb-sticky form is used for most of the complex verb conjugations in japanese, including the ます form, past, て form, たい form, etc.


The "some such" form is used in some conditions and is sometimes considered the base of the short potentials.


The imperative form is an imperative form. It forms rough commands.


Traditional japanese grammar analyzes the long potential form of one-form verbs as られる itself attached to the base stem, not れる attached to a ら. There's no difference between the two interpretations.


The only reason for the one-form verbs to have a 未然形 form, in addition to the identical verb-sticky form, is so that grammarians don't need to give one-form verbs their own rule for the negative. Yes, it's silly.




#### Hidden Intermission


*Intermissions are optional.*


The redundancy of the classical stems, and the fact that they don't cover everything about modern japanese conjugation without additional rules, is why the classical categorization is not used much anymore, except as a reference. The names it introduced are still used though.


Alexander Vovin, a salient academic linguist, considers the 未然形 form to be a figment of [structuralizing classical japanese grammar](https://www.academia.edu/12981120/). I think he's on to something, which is the reason I translated it as the "none such" form. The best part is "none such" is valid translation of 未然 if you think hard enough.


The only reason I named the 已然形/仮定形 form "some such" instead of "hypothetical" is because the stems on their own don't do much in modern japanese, and I wanted to avoid implying that it acts hypothetical on its own. In modern japanese, the "none such" and "some such" forms are basically incomplete and expect something to be attached to them.


[There are other reasons to be careful with classical japanese grammar.](http://no-sword.jp/blog/2005/10/classical-japanese-verb-categories-are.html)


Japanese school grammar cares a lot about the classical bases, and they have their place in the modern interpretation of classical grammar, but they're not *all* useful anymore.


I should emphasize that the 未然形 has real uses of its own in classical japanese. The contention comes from conflating all -a forms of (back then) 四段 verbs with the 未然形 category name, which is named such because of a particular use of it. Modern linguistics treats categories as things that happen when you *use* words, or as features of "universal grammar", and applying categories too widely causes a lot of problems when grammar people try talking to eachother. The 未然形 category is a legitimate description of a real grammatical feature of classical japanese, but the name doesn't fit all uses of the stem.
