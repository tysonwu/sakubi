### Part 4: Communicating


No matter how stubborn the questgiver, rat tails will solve anything. RPG cliches tell us so. Even heroes need to make conversation. At least understand.



#### Lesson 24: "Quoting" with って and と and という/っていう/つう taking note of だって


There are two basic types of relative clause. The first is the kind that modifies a noun, which we already learned about. The second is the embedded clause, which uses a clause without attaching it to a noun, like the second half of "He said that the war would end soon".


って and と, which act like "quotation" markers, mark embedded clauses.


いいと思う I think it's fine.  

元気と言った He said he felt fine.  

見えると聞いた I heard that it's visible.
There are restrictions on the forms that verbs are allowed to take at the end of an embedded clause, except for actual literal quotations. Japanese lets grammar leak between outer and inner clauses in different ways than english does.


って is essentially a colloquial version of と.


駄目って言った She said it was no good.  

何だって？ What did you say?
って can also be an emphasizing particle, or just isolate information.


猫って嫌い！ I **hate** cats!  

日本語難しいって "Japanese is hard".
Now we're going to tackle という/ていう/つう, a construction that uses と/って.


The expression と言う という is used to construct a relative clause in ways that would be awkward otherwise. Not all instances of という are this expression, but normally, if it's written in just hiragana, it's the expression.


研究者という人間 The people that are researchers  

休みたいという訳で Because I want to take a break
It can also just be used for emphasis.


今日という日 The day that is today
っていう is basically という but with って. つう is a contraction of it.


だって is a conjunction or particle (depending on who you ask) made from compounding だ and って, and has the nuance of a rebuttal. This doesn't work the same way as adding って to a clause that already ends in だ, which is also possible.


俺だって負けられない！  

Even if it's me, I can't lose!  

  

だって、今日は祭り  

I mean, today's the festival.
This is only one of the uses of だって. We'll cover the other uses later.




#### Lesson 25: Adverbs with と-adverbs, に-adverbs, and い-adjectives even


Adverbs are words that modify the nature of an event. In english, the "liberally" in "Please add sugar liberally" is an adverb. In japanese, adverbs don't inflect like adjectives and verbs do, though you can inflect them before turning them into adverbs.


Japanese has "true" adverbs that can be used with no special marking at all, in addition to other kinds of adverbs.


全く光のない Entirely without light  

全然駄目だ It's no use at all
と-adverbs are words that take と when used as an adverb.


自然と殺す Kill naturally/spontaneously/by nature  

次々と出てきます They're coming out one after the other.
に-adverbs are words that take に when used as an adverb. In fact, except for a few fixed phrases, almost all に-adverbs are nouns of some sort, usually な-adjectives. This is where に turns into an adverbial marker for nouns. A bunch of expressions that are considered grammar features are just nouns with relative clauses on the left side and an adverbial に on the right side.


自由に研究する Study freely  

特別にいいです It's particularly good
い-adjectives can be used as adverbs by replacing the い with a く.
早く起きる Get up early
Adverbs sometimes take する to construct an action about the adverb. This is similar to how the negative form of い-adjectives (e.g. 赤くない) puts く before ない.


広々としている It's spacious.  

確りして Hang in there / Stay frosty / Get a hold of yourself
*(To students of grammar: the use of に as an "adverbial" marker for nouns might have a different etymology than the use of に as an oblique case marker. It might correspond to the defective Old Japanese copula n- \*ni/no2/nite.)*








#### Lesson 26: Sentence ending particles with ね, な, よ, ぜ, ぞ, わ, さ


These are particles that go at the end of statements to show how the speaker feels. The descriptions below are not literal. That is, the given explanation isn't the reason a speaker would actually use the particle. They're just a way to represent the underlying tone. You gotta acquire them yourself.


ね feels as though the speaker wants the listener to agree. When ね comes at the beginning of a sentence, it serves to get attention.


いい天気だね It's good weather, ey?  

ね、来るの？ Hey, are you coming?
な indicates emphasis. Note that there's a different sentence-ender that can conflict with this one, and in such places, this one is usually written with the vowel elongated somehow, and the other normally.


いいなぁ That's good, huh.
よ feels as though the speaker expects other people to know what the speaker knows, or that the speaker wants to share their care.


いいよ It's fine.  

彼が犬だよ He's a dog! (not surprised)
ぞ indicates assertion, but it's not necessarily impolite. It feels slightly non-feminine.


誰もいないぞ Nobody's here, man.  

行くぞ！ A'ight, let's head out! (speaking about himself, to himself)
ぜ is like ぞ but feels more lighthearted. In fact, it can turn otherwise assertive statements into suggestions.


いいだぜ！ It's nice!
Note that adding ぜ to だ makes だぜ act like a compound sentence ending particle, which is the only reason だ is allowed to attach to いい here. This can happen when using other particles with だ, too, not just ぜ.


わ is an exclamation. It usually feels as though the speaker is confident in what they're saying, but not forceful. In stories, it's usually feminine, but sometimes it acts like a "gender enhancer" instead, even for dudeish soldiers.


元気ですわよ！ I'm feeling good!
さ tries to induce optimism, or it hopes the listener will take it easy. さ can also introduce a sentence, just like ね.


犬がいないさ There's no dogs here, see?  

早く起きなくてさ I didn't get up early, and, well.  

さぁ、見てみる Well, let's see.
Finally, looking back at だぜ, we can finally say that the reason です is allowed to attach to い-adjectives is because です itself acts like a sentence-ending particle.
*(To students of grammar: these are "modal particles".)*








#### Lesson 27: Asking kindly with なさい, ください; prohibition with な


なさい asks someone to do something as a matter of course. It feels as though the asker expects the listener to do the action, but it's still a kind request.


聞きなさい Please listen.  

食べなさい Please eat.
ください asks someone to do something for you, or for your benefit. It comes from 下る くだる a verb basically meaning "give", and it's sometimes spelled with 下 even when actual giving is not what's going on.


死んでください Please die.  

アイスください Ice cream, please.
ください can be used with negative verbs, but when it is, the form is made with ないで instead of なくて. This is the same as how you can't say なくている. In situations like this, ないで acts like the て "form" of ない, and なくて doesn't.


死なないでください！ Please don't die!
Finally, we get to using な to indicate prohibition, which attaches to the end of a statement, one without ます and without the past tense. This is the sentence-ender that overlaps with the version of な that does emphasis.


来るな！ Stay away! (Don't come!)
Reality check: なさい can be abbreviated to just な. This is never in conflict with な as in emphasis or prohibition, because it always attaches to the verb-sticky form, not to a statement.


聞きな Listen up.


#### Lesson 28: Question nouns: なに, だれ, どれ, いつ


These are called interrogatives. They're used in order to ask wh-questions. These words can't be used as relative clause markers like english does in "The person who was fine with it". They also show up as parts of larger grammatical words.
何 なに "what"


何するの？  

Whatcha doin'?
誰 だれ "who"


誰だ！  

Who's there!  

  

誰？  

Who?  

  

誰ですか  

Who is it?
どれ basically "which"


どれがいいかなぁ  

I wonder which one would be good.
いつ "when" (not "while" or "at the time that")


いつがいいか  

When's good?  

  

いつから君がいた、ここ？  

How long have you been here?  

(metaphorically, "Since when were you here?")
Japanese is a "wh-in-situ" language, which just means that it doesn't need to move interrogatives around in wh-questions like english does.








#### Lesson 29: か and も as modifying question nouns (note なんと なんて なんか)


When か isn't marking a question, it can turn interrogatives into generic nouns.


なにか something  

だれか someone  

どれか "somewhich" (metaphorically; as in one of the options)  

いつか sometime (sometimes "in due time"/"eventually", like in english)  

  

なにかあった？ Did something happen? (NOT "what happened?")
When も isn't marking grammatical inclusion, it can turn interrogatives into "in/exclusive" nouns. This is more complicated, and aside from だれも they can only be used with negatively "oriented" phrases. (\* orientedness: see footnote)


なにも anything/nothing  

だれも everyone/anyone/noone  

どれも any of them/none of them  

いつも anytime/never  

  

誰もいないか？
どれか and どれも are noticeably less common than the others due to the logical nature of どれ.


The fact that だれも can be used for "everyone" in positive statements is irregular, and every other interrogative has its own irregular "every X", but I can't be bothered to cover them.


There's an obvious logical distinction between "every particular thing" and "any one particular thing". By attaching でも, you give it "any" in the sense of "any one particular thing", and it can be used with positive statements.


私が誰でも助ける I'll save anyone.
With that out of the way, let's look at なんか, which comes from なにか. In practice, なんか is one of the most common filler words in japanese, and is frequently used in places where translations should use "sorta", "like", etc. なんか can still mean "something", but this filler use is too important to ignore.


なんか変！ That's like, weird!
On the topic of なに-based grammatical terms, なんて is frequently used to express belittlement or scorn. なんて isn't always negative, it's a matter of nuance. なんと is used the same way but does not have the negative nuance.


なんて優しい。 How sweet.  

なんと優しい。 How kind. (not sarcastic)
*For more information on negative "orientation", which has to do with how logical inclusion/exclusion works outside of simple statements, see Optional Lesson 1 on "Polarity". All languages do this.*




#### Lesson 30: Saying yes and no with うん, ううん, はい, いいえ, ええ, and いや


The exact situations where different yes/no words are used are pretty much entirely dependent on convention. As such, the rules are too complicated to teach. But I can give a rundown of the common yes/no words anyway.


うん - Yep (casual)  

ううん - Nope (casual)
うん and ううん have completely different tones of voice when spoken.


はい - Yes (general use)  

いいえ - No (polite)  

  

ええ - Yeah (informal, kind)  

いや - No (rough)
Warning: ええ can be an unrelated filler word that feels like the speaker has something to elaborate on or deny, or that they're confused.


In addition to "no", 嫌 いや is also a な-adjective used for unlikeable things.


嫌だ! いやだ！ No!  

嫌なことしないでください Please don't do something bad.
いや can also be said as や. This usually isn't done if it'd be confusing.




#### Lesson 31: Generic nouns and nominalization with 事, 物, ところ, and の


事 こと and 物 もの both mean "thing". 事 is generally used for intangibles like actions or states, and 物 is generally used for tangibles like objects.


私のこと知らないの？ D'ya not know about me?  

可愛いもの好き I like cute things.
所 ところ is a word that means "place", and is used in similar patterns, including ones about intangible places like places in time or progress, and facets/aspects of an entity. Singling out an abstract point in time is extremely flexible, and can imply things like completion, change in state, etc.


彼女は珍しいところもある There's some unusual points to her, too.  

同情したところで、過去はもう―― Even if I had felt the same, the past is already... ("By the point I felt the same, ...")
All three of these generic nouns can turn entire phrases into nouns. This lets japanese use phrases like things without using embedded clauses. This is basically a special simplified case of the relative clauses we learned about in lesson 11.


そんなもののために死ぬことはない  

There's no dying for such a thing.  

(Metaphorically, "There is not to die for the purpose of such a thing")  

  

このところ夜は  

Recent nights  

  

事件なんかあったものね  

Well, some kind of incident happened.
Both of these uses extend to の for some reason.


赤いのはいいよ  

The red one is fine.  

  

いつ使用するのがいいですか  

When should I use it?  

(Metaphorically, "When is using good?")
This use of の is the reason の is used in のだ.


#### Optional Lesson 1: Polarity


*This is a very hard lesson. This lesson is completely optional.*


This topic is very hard to explain because it's so intuitive, and happens at a level so far away from language itself.


Because this optional lesson is so hard, you might want to try learning polarity in an easier way instead. Try watching [this video from The Ling Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8cjyxHQdw) first. It might be all you need.



Video link: [Why Can't "Any" Go Just Anywhere? NPIs; The Ling Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8cjyxHQdw)


First of all, it's important to note that polarity isn't a grammatical category or a type of word, like "tense" or "verb" are. Instead, polarity is something that the human mind does, that it enforces on language, and in the process, makes complicated logical constructions less contextual.


Because it's almost entirely subconscious, you don't notice it, so when polarity is explained in an abstract way, it's confusing. But polarity is an easy grammatical process. It's just hard to talk about because it operates, basically, at a level before words.


The simplest form of polarity is when words can only be used with negative phrases. "Rejecting" positive phrases is basically why it's called polarity.

"I'm not cooking yet."
It's not normal to say "I'm cooking yet". You might be able to in certain situations, but not neutral ones.


The hard form of polarity has to do with logical entailment, and can show up in entirely "positive" phrases. The simplest triggers of backwards polarity in positive phrases are "any" and "every". This is why some uses of も act funny. Questions can do this same thing. This is why か doesn't always make questions.


"Has anyone left yet?"
Another example of a word that dislikes neutral positive phrases is "ever".


"I hate everyone I've ever met."  

"I haven't ever said that."  

"Has he ever come?"
It would be unnatural to say "I have ever come" in a neutral situation.


The only way to explain this kind of polarity is to accept that the "direction" of "logical entailment" is what triggers different polarities, not negativity. One way to think about this is to think which way implications point when you negate things.


"I've had potato chips before" implies "I've had snacks before"  

"I haven't had potato chips before" doesn't imply "I haven't had snacks before"
In fact, the implication isn't just destroyed, it's outright reversed.


"I've had snacks before" doesn't imply "I've had potato chips before"  

"I haven't had snacks before" implies "I haven't had potato chips before"
Specific things imply general things. Specific things entail general things.


Polarity happens because some words only make sense when the "direction" of "entailment" is pointing a certain direction for what they're modifying.


"I haven't had snacks" is general in the sense that it leaves a lot open in the future, but it doesn't leave a lot open in the past. "haven't" implies that the past is fixed, the statement must be true in the past. But the future is still "general" because it's uncertain.


When you add "yet", it takes the statement and makes super sure that it's not implying anything about the future. It takes "uncertainty" about the future and turns it into "objective uncertainty" about the future. "Objective uncertainty" is more specific than "uncertainty".


With "I've had snacks", the future is already set in stone. You can't go to a future where the statement starts being false. There's no room for "yet" here, since "yet" operates on uncertain futures.


The only way for it to make sense is if the logic starts from "yet", like "I have yet to have snacks", which takes an uncertain future and puts a positive statement on it, and means basically the same as "I haven't had snacks yet".


When there isn't enough polarity at play, logical entailment can make things ambiguous. Polarity makes ambiguous combinations of entailment less common.


When you use words like this, you just know. You already know how to use them, where they can be used, how they work. In your head, it's not this complex.


At the very least, this is a good example why grammar can't really be taught.
