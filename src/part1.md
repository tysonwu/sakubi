### Part 1: Getting Started


Everyone has to start somewhere. If you're not a kid, it's a lot easier to get started if you compare to what you already know. Let's do that for a while. It's not as good as reading japanese, but it'll help a lot.


*(This guide assumes you know the kana, you're learning vocabulary, and you have a mouseover dictionary like Rikaisama (for Firefox) or Yomichan (for Chrome/Opera). If you don't, go fix that.)*



#### Lesson 1: State of being with だ and です


Japanese has two basic "is" words. The grammar term for "is" words is "copula". Copulas have a dedicated term because they're special.


The two copulas in japanese are だ and です. です is more polite than だ. Despite both being copulas, they can't always be used in the same patterns.


Unlike english, the state-of-being word goes **after** the word that you're using to describe something, rather than before it.


ペンだ  

It's a pen.  

  

ネコです  

It is a cat.
The difference between だ and です is sometimes translated as a difference in whether a contraction is used, but this is **not** what's happening in japanese.


Later on, we'll see です get used in places that english wouldn't allow "is". It can act like a filler word instead of a copula.


Japanese has two basic tenses: the simple tense and the simple past tense. Dictionaries list verbs by their simple tense. We're only using the word "simple" to say that nothing else is added to the verb.


The simple past form of だ is だった. The simple past form of です is でした.


オレだった！  

It was me!  

  

そうでした  

That was so.
The simple tense is usually called the present tense or the non-past tense. It's important to remember that it can be used in a lot of situations. Present tense and non-past tense are reasonable names, but don't treat names like rules, sometimes names are confusing. We'll be using these names interchangeably.


The simple tense and simple past tense usually line up with english's present and past tenses, but they're not used in all the same places. Just remember that english and japanese use tense in different ways.


In japanese, ordinary statements about the future use the simple tense most of the time. This is where the name "non-past" comes from.


The simple past tense is usually just called the past tense. Sometimes it can also be used for things that already completed like "has become", even if they're hypothetical and haven't happened yet.




#### Intermission: Vowels


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them.*


Japanese only has five vowels. The quality of the vowels sometimes changes slightly depending on the sounds near them, but not enough to make new vowels.


Unlike english, japanese has a very regular orthography (how writing corresponds to sounds). The japanese vowels are, for our intents and purposes, always pronounced the same way, except for when they're not pronounced at all. More on that later.


Resources about the japanese vowel sounds are widespread on the internet. Explaining sounds through text is a fool's errand.




#### Lesson 2: Nouns, pronouns


Japanese has nouns and pronouns, just like english. Pronouns are less special than they are in english, and act like normal nouns most of the time.


Japanese does not have a plural form. Nouns and verbs don't have to agree for plurality, person, or gender. Japanese can explicitly refer to a group by attaching certain suffixes to nouns, but none of them are a true plural, they all convey extra information that plurals don't.


Japanese has tons of personal pronouns (me, you, them) that english doesn't, but the demonstrative pronoun system (this, that, these, those) is much less irregular. Also, japanese pronouns never change form for case like english ones do (he vs him), though you can put suffixes on them.


Don't bother memorizing these word lists. Learn words outside of this guide.


私・わたし me (normal, slightly formal when men use it)  

あたし me (casual, feminine)  

俺・おれ me (casual, masculine)  

僕・ぼく me (casual or polite, masculine)  

彼・かれ him  

彼女・かのじょ her / lady  

あなた you

達 is a suffix. This suffix can be applied to pronouns and nouns. This suffix refers to the group the noun/pronoun is in.


私達・わたしたち Us  

ジム達・じむたち Jim and company  

ペン達・ぺんたち The pen and stuff

達 is normally for living things, and the usage with "pen" above is considered colloquial, or at least informal. It just shows up enough to mention.


Japanese has compound words. They work the same way as in english.


町・まち town, district  

中・なか inside, middle  

町中・まちなか downtown, in town, the middle of town

Japanese has prefixes and suffixes just like english. This is different than compound words. Prefixes and suffixes can't stand on their own.


研究・けんきゅう research  

研究者・けんきゅうしゃ researcher

者, pronounced しゃ here, is a suffix. It can act like a piece of a compound word, but can't stand on its own as its own word. When 者 appears on its own in a sentence, it's a different word, and not pronounced as しゃ. *Thanks, kanji.*


昨日, meaning "yesterday", is normally read as きのう, not さくび. But since it's this guide's name, it can have a reading different than the normal word spelled the same way. Watch out for reading variation when you start reading, or you'll be super confused.




#### Intermission: Long vowels and gemination


*Intermissions are optional.*


In japanese, "long vowel" doesn't mean what it means when you're talking about english. Japanese long vowels literally last longer.


Japanese also has something called "gemination". Gemination means that the speaker briefly stops on a consonant. In japanese, this adds the same amount of time as using a long vowel. Practice the following to get a hang of the idea:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Kata | Ka-ta |
| Kaata | Ka-a-ta |
| Katta | Ka-t-ta |


The letter t isn't pronounced twice in the third example. There's a point in time when the mouth stops making the first "a" sound and is in the position of the "t" sound, but the air is blocked. It's not released until the "ta".


Long e is sometimes spelled as ei えい. Not all instances of えい are a long e. But all instances of えい that are a long e can also be pronounced as literally え followed by い. It can sound stiff, but it's still correct. To illustrate:


えい (not a long e): Only pronounced as えい  

えい (is a long e): Can be pronounced えい or ええ

Long o is sometimes spelled as ou おう. Not all instances of おう are a long o. Unlike えい, sequences of おう can only be pronounced a certain way, depending on whether it's a long o or not. おう is used this way because it reduces how many words have the same spelling.


おう (not a long o): Only pronounced おう  

おう (is a long o): Only pronounced おお

お and う are so close that the distinction between おう and おお might be hard to hear or articulate in casual speech, but the distinction is always *intended*.


Most instances of おう that are not long o sounds are verb endings. But there's one verb ending where this is not the case: the volitional, taught later.




#### Lesson 3: Particles and grammatical case


Japanese has "particles". Particles are similar to prepositions. They mark an entire phrase as having some logical relationship to something else. Japanese particles come after the phrase they're modifying instead of before it.


English uses word order when you need to know what job each noun has in a sentence: subject, verb, object. This can get flipped around in other patterns and in poetry, but word order is english's main thing here.


These jobs are called grammatical "cases", and each job is a particular "case".


Japanese uses particles to indicate these jobs. There's a default word order, and you can drop particles, but particles are the norm.


Remember: these translations are only for demonstration, and the japanese sentences are not necessarily natural-sounding. The sentences and translations are only here for illustration, not instruction.


ジムがネコを食べた  

じむが　ねこを　たべた  

Jim ate cat.
Here, が marks "Jim" as the subject. を marks ねこ as the direct object. The subject of a verb like "eat" is the person doing the eating.


Japanese throws a wrench into the picture by having something we call a "topic marker", は, which literally just says "this is what I'm talking about". Most grammar resources compare は to が. They do this because sometimes it's unnatural to use が, and you have to use は instead, or leave the subject unstated. But は is more general than being an alternative to が.


ネコはイヌが食べた The cat, a dog ate it.  

イヌはネコを食べた The dog ate a cat.

One way to differentiate は and が here is thinking of が as a focus marker. This "focus" is in **addition** to が's behavior as a subject marker, not instead of it.


ジムがネコを食べた Jim is the one that ate the cat.
English uses articles and swip-swappy sentence patterns for this kind of focus.


ネコは魚食べる  

Cats eat fish (cats in general)  

The cat eats fish (the cat we were talking about)  

  

ネコが魚食べる  

A cat eats fish (about a particular arbitrary cat)  

The cat eats fish (about a relevant cat)  

Cats are what eat fish (cats in particular)
Japanese is a "subject-object-verb" (SOV) language. That is, normal statements have subject, object, and verb in that order. English is SVO. Both languages allow moving the parts around, but doing so changes where the emphasis goes.


If you need more information on は, view ["Unit 8: Particle wa" of "Visualizing Japanese Grammar"](https://www2.gwu.edu/~eall/vjgnew/vjghomepage/vjghome.htm).




#### Intermission: Devoicing


*Intermissions are optional.*



In certain places, the vowels "u" and "i" can be "devoiced", meaning that they're not pronounced at all. です and でした are examples. It's still acceptable to pronounce the vowels in these cases, but you'll sound weird.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Desu | De-s |
| Deshita | De-sh-ta |


Don't bother learning any more about devoicing until you're much better at japanese. It'll make it harder to notice irregular devoicing patterns that people don't bother teaching.




#### Lesson 4: の means の: possession and attributes; bonus: honorifics


の is a particle. It's a possessive marker and an attributive marker. "Attributive" here means that something is an attribute of something else, like an attribute in a video game, like the "flame" in "flame sword". The relationship is always straightforward.


私のネコ My cat  

君の Yours.  

ネコの先 Ahead of the cat  

男の子 Boy (metaphorically, male child)
If you get lost, the easiest way to remember の is: It's like "of", but applies backwards.


夜の人 Person of the night
Sometimes "of" gets confusing, and you have to remember the idea "attribute".


夜の海 The night sea  

海の夜 Night on the sea (NOT "night of the sea")
の is literally the single most common word in all of japanese, so make sure you remember it well!


私の子供のネコが多い  

My child's cats are many. (My kid has a lot of cats.)
Let's take a moment to learn about honorifics. If you're consumed any translated japanese media, there's a good chance you already understand this.


When referring to another person by name, their name usually takes a suffix like さん, くん, さま, or ちゃん. This is not an exhaustive list of honorifics, and they have a lot of context-specific nuances that would take a long time to memorize. Just keep in mind their function.


Just like the honorific titles Mister, Miss, Master, Sir, and Lord in english, japanese honorifics indicate the attitude the speaker is taking towards that person, and/or towards their relationship with that person. It's much less normal to use the honorific alone in japanese than english, so they act more like suffixes than independent extra words.


Referring to someone by name without any honorific at all might be familiar or intimate, or assuming of your interpersonal relationship with them. This is extra true if you use their given name instead of their family name.




#### Intermission: Spelling irregularities


*Intermissions are optional.*


Japanese has a small number of spelling irregularities. These irregularities make written japanese easier to read, not harder.
Particles: When the particles は, を, and へ are spoken, they're pronounced as "wa", "o", and "e", not as "ha", "wo", or "he". Actually, "wo" is still correct, and you see it all the time in singing, but it sounds silly in normal speech.


Words: The word 言う いう, meaning "say", is pronounced ゆう when in the simple tense (dictionary form).


Japanese has a "pitch accent" system, where words have a specific change in pitch (or none) that distinguishes them. This is **not** the same thing as stress or tone.


Pitch accent is not represented when japanese is written in kana.


Pitch accent is actually very important if you want to speak, so [you're going to have to find a resource for that if you want one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_s6QqmJd7k).


Japanese isn't "robotic", "monotone", or "flat". Japanese has prosody, just like english. Every language has prosody. Prosody is the natural "musicalness" of language.








#### Lesson 5: Moving things with に, へ, and から


These particles mainly deal with location. から indicates the starting point of an action, and へ and に indicate the ending point of an action.


から is the same general "from" you see in english, even when it's abstract.


学校から私に家へ手紙を送った  

[He] sent me home a letter from school.
The english translation doesn't even have any marking on three of the nouns. Particles make things easier, at least for a language learner.


The subject was dropped in the japanese version of this sentence. The subject can be dropped in japanese if it's understood. This is just like how english uses pronouns. If you don't drop something that's obvious enough to drop, it emphasizes it.


へ translates well as "to" or "toward" in most situations, including abstract ones.


東京へ行く Going to Tokyo / Headed for Tokyo
に can mark an indirect object or a location.


An indirect object is something relevant to or affected by a verb, but not part of the verb's core meaning. This overlaps with へ a little, but へ cares more about motion and towardsness, and に cares more about the noun itself.


学校に来た Came to school.
Location is easy.


学校に暮らす I live in school.
The idea of "indirect object" used by に can show up in places that would look like direct objects in english.


研究者になる Becomes a researcher.  

ここに来た He came here.
In this way, に becomes a general "first option" for things that look like direct objects but cannot take を for the equivalent verb in japanese. There are other particles that also do this job, which we will cover later. For certain meanings, you can only use a given particle, not an arbitrary one.


These particles can be used in other ways, but we're not ready for that yet.


This is a good time to remember that particles attach to phrases, not words. This applies to every particle we've learned so far.


私の家から来た Came from my house


#### Intermission: Consonant irregularity


*Intermissions are optional.*


*The italic text in this intermission will indicate values in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Letters).*


The consonant g is sometimes pronounced ng, even at the beginning of words. In modern times, this is a matter of accent, not variation between dialects. It feels prestigious, not slangy, but it's being phased out.


The syllable ん is **always** pronounced as m before "p" and "b", **always** pronounced as ng (*ŋ*) before "k" and "g", and **always** pronounced like ng (*ɴ*) at the end of an utterance. Basically, it merges with whatever comes after it, just like how the "input" is usually pronounced "imput", and "inking" as "ingking".


Most japanese syllables use the consonants regularly. Only a couple don't.


Within the basic kana, only the kana ふ, つ, し, and ち have irregular consonant sounds. They are, in effect, "fu" (*ɸu*), "tsu", "shi" (*ɕi*), and "chi" (*t͡ɕi*), in order.


When they're voiced, three of the four irregular basic kana, づ, じ, and ぢ, change qualities slightly. So does ず.


In standard japanese, ず and づ are in free variation. Either one can be pronounced as dzu or zu.


The same is true with じ and ぢ pronounced as ji (*ʑi*) (as in the second consonant in "vision") or dji (*d͡ʑi*) (as in the first consonant in "James").


ず・づ and じ・ぢ being treated the same way is a feature of the standard accent. Other accents can merge the four of them together even more, or not merge them at all.


When し, ち, じ, and ぢ start diphthongs, like ちゃ, ぢゃ, しゃ, and じゃ, the "i/y" sound in the middle is dropped. For example, ちゃ is **always** pronounced as "cha" (*t͡ɕa*), never as "chya" (*t͡ɕja*). Normal diphthongs like きゃ are pronounced the normal way, like "kya" (*kja*).




#### Lesson 6: What is a verb? Nothing but a miserable pile of conjugations!


Unlike english, japanese has several categories of regular verbs. In other words, unlike english, japanese says that all of its verb categories are regular. Even though you might say that "ashen" and "eaten" are irregular in english, japanese doesn't follow the same logic.


Right now, japanese has two categories of regular verbs. It used to have categories of categories, but there's only two categories right now. The two categories are one-form verbs and five-form verbs, which conjugate differently.


Here's an example, using a ます form that we'll learn properly in Lesson 12. Don't bother memorizing this table.


見る／見ます, "one-form" verb.  

切る／切ります, "five-form" verb, ending in る.  

買う／買います, "five-form" verb, ending in う.  

死ぬ／死にます, "five form" verb, ending in ぬ.
One-form verbs always end in る, and just drop the る when they conjugate. The stuff leading up to that る is the verb's basic identity, and isn't changed. The verb itself, aside from conjugation, has only "one form".


Five form verbs can end in one of several syllables. In the present tense, this syllable always ends in a "u" vowel, and different conjugations can change it to any of the other four vowels in japanese, or slur it. This means that it can have any of five different vowels at the end. In other words, five forms.


Five-form verbs in the dictionary form can end in one of several different syllables, but it always ends in the vowel "u".


切る　殺す　死ぬ　選ぶ　読む　問う　動く　急ぐ　持つ

One-form verbs in the dictionary form always end in る. But the part before the る always ends in a phonetic "e" or "i". The dictionary form just attaches る to the one-form verb's *one and only base*, the part of the one-form verb that never changes.
Japanese verb conjugation likes to pile words together, and you end up with things like 見られたくなかった. Over the next few lessons, we start learning the logic behind these long piles of conjugations. This makes them easier to break down.


This lesson is just establishing the basics needed to understand what we're going to look at.








#### Intermission: "Synthetic" language


*Intermissions are optional.*


Japanese is synthetic. The linguistics term "synthetic" means that a language likes to synthesize (!) words out of small parts. Generally speaking. Above all, "synthetic" does **not** mean a manufactured, synthesized language itself.


Japanese is a synthetic language, due to it piling verb conjugations on top of eachother like 見られたくなかった. Piling things together like this is called "agglutinative". When you make complicated meanings with single pieces that have several implications, that's called "fusional". Japanese is not fusional.


The opposites of synthetic are "analytic" and "isolating". Chinese is both analytic and isolating. English is considered an analytic language because it loves function words and has relatively few productive inflections, but less isolating because it loves derivational affixes.


The exact definitions of "analytic" and "isolating" tend to be fuzzy, because extremely analytic or extremely isolating languages tend to be both, not just one or the other. Modern linguists think that categories like these, in the vague sense, aren't that useful at categorizing all the languages, just the ones that grammar people liked looking at.




#### Lesson 7: Negated verbs and using い-adjectives


When you turn a one-form verb into a negative verb, it cuts off the る at the end of the simple tense and adds ない.


For five-form verbs, you turn the ending "u" into an "a", with one exception.


These examples are for illustration. You should not memorize them, just understand them for now and move on.


1-form: Drop る, add ない  



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 見る | 見ない |
| 食べる | 食べない |




5-form: Replace "u" with "a", then add ない  



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 殺す | 殺さない |
| 切る | 切らない |
| 買う | 買わない |
| 問う | 問わない |



食べない not eating / to not eat
For five-form verbs ending in う, the negative uses わない, not あない. This is that one exception.


Japanese has two types of adjectives. Don't worry, it's not the same deal as the two categories of verbs. い-adjectives act like verbs. な-adjectives act like nouns. We'll cover な-adjectives later.


Here's an example of an い-adjective in practice.


赤い火 Red fire
The reason い-adjectives "act like verbs" is because you don't use だ with them.


火が赤いThe fire is red.
"is" is only present in the translation. In fact, attaching だ here would be ungrammatical. **Do not** attach だ to い-adjectives.


火が赤い*だ* (ungrammatical gargling)
Attaching です is okay, but です doesn't indicate state of being here, it just adds politeness. This is the first major way that だ and です are different. When it's not attached to a noun, です is just a politeness marker.


火が赤いです The fire is red.
There are more constructions that end up putting a だ or です right at the end of い-adjectives, but they don't indicate state of being like attaching だ or です to a noun does.


Like verbs, you can conjugate い-adjectives. Replace い with かった or くない.


火が赤かった The fire was red.  

火が赤くない The fire is not red.

ない is an い-adjective and you can conjugate it like one.


見なかった Did not see.


Adjectives are turned into abstract nouns with さ. There are more ways to do this, but さ is by far the most common.


大きさ Size (largeness) (from 大きい)




#### Intermission: What's subarashiki about poetry anyway?


*Intermissions are optional.*


In classical japanese, the attributive form of い-adjectives ended in き, not い, and き is therefore an adnominal form. You'll run into this form all the time since it's still intelligible to native speakers, so it's no use hiding it.


Japanese stories like to use literary language features once in a while, just like english. Just as a novel might misuse "wherefore", so too will a japanese novel misuse <confusing literary term X>. While this doesn't apply to the き ending of い-adjectives, it does apply to things too advanced to be covered here, for sure.


All the same, you're going to have to acquire the misused versions of literary terms in order to understand them when writers misuse them. That's part of the experience of the language, how <feature X> is used, not just what it's "supposed" to mean.


Uneducated attempts to sound archaic are definitely not 素晴らしき, but the low-grade tone of voice you can get out of just the right use of old grammar, or the jokes you can make when characters know different parts of it, those are definitely 素晴らしき.


Classical japanese actually has a couple different categories that evolved into modern い-adjectives, but you don't have to worry about that.




#### Lesson 8: The verb strikes back: the past tense


You form the past tense of a verb by attaching た or だ to the right "stem". Stems are basically the shortest verb forms you can write. You attach the right stuff to the end of the right stem when you want to make complex conjugations.


We're introducing stems now because the past tense of five-form verbs uses irregular stems.


90% of the time, you only use three stems. Here's an example:


殺す　死ぬ  

殺さ　死な  

殺し　死に/死ん

Here's an example of these stems in use:


殺す  

"he kills"  

殺さない  

"he doesn't kill"  

殺した  

"he killed"

That's right. Basic stuff like tense and negation uses only three stems. There are more stems, but they show up less often. We'll cover them later.


With that out of the way, we can introduce the past tense properly. We've seen the past tense forms of だ and です already, which are だった and でした. We also saw 殺した in the stem example above.


You'd be right to assume that the た is what makes it the past tense. The hard part, and the reason for the delay, is that the stem for the past tense of five-form verbs isn't as regular as the stem for the negative form. It depends on the exact original syllable ending. Here are all possibilities:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 切る | 殺す | 死ぬ | 選ぶ | 読む | 買う | 問う | 動く | 急ぐ | 持つ |
| 切った | 殺した | 死んだ | 選んだ | 読んだ | 買った | 問うた | 動いた | 急いだ | 持った |


Don't memorize this table. There's a rule for this, it's just irregular. Replace the "u" vowel with an "i" vowel, so you get like 切り, 死に, etc. Then attach the た, but slur it. The slurring is what makes it irregular. In particular, notice 死んだ and 急いだ.


Japanese speakers don't go through this process whenever they conjugate something. This process is like trivia to them. The "slurring" is a historic thing, and the slurred version is just what the form is now. At the very least, if you do a little reading and listening in japanese, you will be able to recognize the past tense at a glance. Exposure is more powerful than memorization.


The past tense of one-form verbs is easy. Replace the る with a た.


見る　見た  

食べる　食べた

We will learn another use of this stem, one where it's not slurred with five-form verbs, in Lesson 12.


Conjugation is more complicated than this, but take this one step at a time.


*(問う, 請う, and 恋う have irregular past conjugations among う-final five-form verbs. They might not be particularly common verbs, but they use a う stem for the past tense instead of the lengthened consonant. This is an example of the slurring being irregular.)*






#### Intermission: About jargon


*Intermissions are optional.*


First of all, a disclaimer: 問うた might not be used that often anymore. I was told 問いかけた is the normal way of saying it in speech, a phrasal verb. All the same, it's not hard to find 問うた.


The two categories of regular verbs have several english names, but only one japanese name each: 一段 and 五段. In english, they're called consonant or vowel stem verbs, ichidan or godan verbs, or "ru" and "u" verbs.


"ru" and "u" is the worst distinction. There are 五段 verbs that end in る.


"Consonant" vs "vowel" implies that the reader already understands how japanese conjugation works. It also implies that's the actual difference between the two categories, when in reality, there could be any number of consonant or vowel categories.


"One-form" and "five-form" what you get when you translate 一段 and 五段 in a way that makes sense in plain english. Translated formally, you get "monograde" and "pentagrade" (less common), and you see these words in scholarly writing. You find "monograde", "bigrade", and "quadrigrade" in writing about historical japanese.




#### Lesson 9: The て particle, the て form, and the imperative


Don't worry if this lesson seems hard. We're just covering fundamentals, you're not expected to internalize the ideas here yet.


There's a verb form that ends in て. This verb form is used in three main ways: to connect statements to eachother, to connect verbs to eachother, and as a simple command. We split this in two: the "て particle" and the "て form".


**The て "form"** is made by replacing the past tense's た with て. Keep in mind that this isn't some kind of secondary past tense.


殺して　切って　買って　死んで　食べて

The main use of the て form is the pattern **XてY**. This pattern uses Y to modify the meaning of X, and Y usually isn't literal.


The following two examples use てあげる and てもらう. We learn these for real near the end of this guide. They're kind of advanced, and you shouldn't try to understand them yet, just the **XてY** construction.


殺してあげる　I'm going to kill you.

In this example, the verb あげる attaches to the て "form" of 殺す. Normally, あげる means "raise something", but because it's used in this pattern, it means "give". The speaker is "giving" the action 殺す to someone else, probably you.


助けてもらう　roughly "is gratefully saved" or "receives help"  

save (te form) + receive

Here, the "receive" word, もらう, modifies 助ける's て form. This doesn't just emphasize how grateful they are for being saved. 助ける normally takes the savior as the subject, but the phrase 助けてもらう takes the survivor as the subject. The **XてY** pattern isn't just attaching the verb Y to an earlier statement, it makes a whole new verb phrase, with different grammar.


The て "form" of い-adjectives is Xい -> Xいで, so ない -> ないで. い-adjectives don't like the て "form" that much. You usually only see the て form of い-adjectives if the adjective is part of a verb conjugation, like ない.


食べないでください  

Please don't eat.
Here, 食べないで is the て "form" of 食べない, and ください is a "please" word that's attached to it.


The て "form" can make a simple command by using it alone. You can think of this like an implied ください for now.


食べて、少年 Eat, boy.  

見て！ Look!  

食べないで Please don't eat.
Now, **the "て particle"**. For verbs, the て "particle" and "form" are identical. For い-adjectives, you replace the い with くて.


食べなくて　赤くて

The main use of the て "particle" is to string statements together in a single sentence.


物分りがよくて助かる It'd help a lot to have a good understanding.  

彼女の目を見て、僕は告げる。 Looking her in the eyes, I say it.

In the first example, the statement 物分りがよくて is followed by the statement 助かる. 助かる is not modifying よくて. Instead, the first statement is setting up the context for the second statement.


The second example just strings the statements together the same way the translation does.


Sometimes the て "particle" lets a verb act as a topic. In this way, the て "particle" can look like a noun. It's not *really* a noun, it just looks like one in situations like this. *(To students of grammar: this is **not** a gerund, it just translates to a gerund here.)*


食べてはいい　It's good to eat.  

起きなくては　いけない　It's no good not to get up. ("Not getting up is no good.")
The て particle of ない, なくて, usually carries a "didn't X, so Y" nuance. But this is just a nuance. There's no literal indication of cause and effect here. It's just one of the possible nuances of なくて and some other uses of the て particle.


早く起きなくて　仕事に遅れた　I didn't get up early, and I was late for work. (reason)
This brings us to the fourth common verb stem, **the imperative** (commanding) form. This is a "true" imperative form, rather than the "simple command" made by using the て "form" alone. Basically, the imperative form usually sounds rude.


The imperative of one-form verbs is ろ, and the imperative of five-form verbs replaces the u with an e.


死にながら見ろ  

Look as I die  

  

殺せ Kill them!  

切れ  

買え
There's an alternative imperative for one-form verbs, but you can ignore it until you're adept. Just remember that it exists.


食べよ Eat!


#### Intermission: What even is an infinitive?


*Intermissions are useful, but if they stress you out, you shouldn't read them. Especially this one.*


In the grammar taught in schools, english speakers are usually taught that verbs like "to go" are infinitives, without being given a good explanation about what that means or why they're called that.


In the study of latin, verb forms could be categorized based on whether they contained information about subject, and these categories were obvious, because latin verbs have to agree with their subject's gender, just like they can with number/person in english (I go, you go, he goes).


However, some verb forms in latin contain literally no information about the subject. Such verbs are called "non-finite", because they didn't "finish up" (see: FINIte) the information necessary to make a real statement with the verb. Infinitive is the most non-finite a verb can be.


This concept is hard to explain when you move away from "fusional" languages like latin, because you stop containing so much extra information in the verb forms, and you even end up with subtle overlap between infinitives and gerunds.


There's light on the other end of the tunnel. The main use of infinitives in english is to link verbs with words that *do* have a "finite"ness to them.


"I want to go now."  

"It's not that he's going to be late, he just doesn't know what to do".
Here, "to go", "to be late", and "to do" are (respectively) clearly attached to "want", "going", and "what". The rule isn't as simple as "stick two verbs together", and the same is true with japanese's て "form" and the stem the て "form" attaches to.


However, because japanese is a topic-prominent language **and** has no fusion, the concept of "finite"ness is even harder to understand against it than english. Linguisticians are working hard at problems like this and have a lot of really good ideas, but they're unintelligible to normal language learners.


Because of this, as well as the fact that linking an abstract verb to a less abstract verb is *not* their only use, the て "form" and its stem won't be called infinitives in this guide. But the comparison to infinitives is glossed over almost everywhere, so I thought I should point it out for the two of you that actually understand infinitives.




#### Lesson 10: Being more with で, では, and じゃ


Normally, で marks the "circumstance" or "means" behind an action. Circumstance can be a location.


剣で出来ている  

Is made out of swords  

  

刀で殺した  

Killed (others) with a katana  

  

バスで来た  

Came by bus  

  

学校で働く  

Working at school
で comes from contracting にて. You see にて in old fashioned writing.


で can also be used like it's the て "particle" of だ. It's not **actually** the て "particle" of だ, but it's close enough for japanese grammar to say it is.


私は彼が本当に犬で慌てる  

He's really a dog and I'm flustered.  

(I'm flustered that he's really a dog.)
This brings us to では. では is a compound particle. The は here is the topic marker, but では's meaning isn't defined as the sum of its parts. では marks the circumstance or condition of another state.


公園ではアイスが売られる  

Ice cream is sold at the park.
This extends to state of being.


私は学生ではない  

I am not a student.
The conversational version of the above uses じゃ, a contraction of では.


私は学生じゃない  

I'm not a student.
Because it's not contracted, ではない is a low grade formal negative assertion. In fact, じゃない is basically the negative version of だ. The etymology of だ has で in it, but we'll learn that etymology later.


Some dialects have different normal spoken copulas than だ. Examples are や and じゃ. This じゃ is a contraction of something other than では. では is not a copula.


ペンじゃ  

'ts a pen. (it's a pen.)


#### Intermission: Japanese japanese grammar is bad, too, actually


*Intermissions are optional.*


In japanese school grammar, で is considered the て "particle" of だ. (Well, they don't distinguish the て form and て particle, but same difference.) This is because of the way it can act like a conjunction. Make sure not to confuse the words "conjugation" and "conjunction".

It's confusing when you learn the etymology of だ, because you end up with a system where で and だ are derived from eachother with に caught in the crossfire.


ツインテールになりました  

I became twintails.  

  

本当にツインテールで嬉しい  

(Garbled dysfluent otaku noises)
The easiest way to think of things is that they lead back to に and て, not だ. But it's important to remember that japanese school grammar still considers で to be the て "particle" of だ, because it's allowed to act like it is.


This is one of the reasons I presented the て "particle" and て "form" as different things.


Some instances of にて might actually be a fossilized proto-japanese copula, not a combination of the に and て particles, but it basically merged with the case particle sequence にて at some point, and both interpretations are valid. This "fossilized proto-japanese copula" is basically treated as the reason why で is allowed to "act like the て particle of だ" sometimes.




#### Lesson 11: Getting detailed with relative clauses and な-adjectives


*In grammar, a "clause" is a phrase that contains a single statement. "It's already over" is a clause. The "I'm late" in "I'm sorry I'm late" is a clause. Compound sentences, like "I'm late because the traffic was bad", contain multiple clauses.*


Relative clauses are statements that are somehow embedded inside another statement. We're going to cover relative clauses that modify nouns. Relative clauses that modify nouns act like "the house *I used to live in*".


To make a verb modify a noun directly, you just attach the verb to the front of the noun. This means that japanese verbs basically act like adjectives. Adjectives can also be used in relative clauses, even with a subject.


食べる人  

Person that eats  

  

私にくれる人  

People that give to me
The simple tense of だ can't make a relative clause, but its past tense can.


必要だ物です  

(ungrammatical frothing)  

  

好きだった食べ物  

Food that I liked
In rare circumstances, that rule can be broken, but it's a real rule, not a fake one. Don't make relative clauses with just だ.


In relative clauses, の is allowed to mark the subject instead of が, even if you leave out the noun that the relative clause is modifying.


君の来た場所 The place you came  

全く光のない Totally without light ("where light totally is not")
Now let's look at な-adjectives, named after the な that comes after them.


バカな子供  

Stupid kid  

  

大好きな人  

Dearly beloved person
な-adjectives act like nouns if you don't attach the な.


君が好きだ  

I like you.  

(You are liked.)
な acts like a suffix for な-adjectives that makes a relative clause. な can even be used this way on a lot of normal nouns, not just な-adjectives. But な-adjectives are special, and dictionaries have different categories for nouns and な-adjectives. Some な-adjectives aren't "normal" nouns. It's weird if you use them as a noun in the wrong place.


の-adjectives are nouns that are special because they turn into full-blown adjectives when の is attached, instead of turning into a general attribute or a possessive. This is different than な-adjectives which are always special.


英語の本  

English-language books. (NOT "books of english")
*(To students of grammar: this use of の is a full blown genitive case. The normal use of の with nouns for attribution and possession is similar to the genitive, but distinct, especially because japanese has の-adjectives.)*




#### Intermission: The dreaded parse and auxiliary verbs


*Intermissions are optional.*


When relative clauses come together in a sufficiently complex way, "parsing", or selecting the right relationship between words, gets increasingly complex. In all languages, the *correct parse* is selected with a combination of common sense and how common the possible patterns are.


Here's a popular meme about this exact phenomenon.


顔が赤い魚を食べた猫  

  

(顔が赤い)(魚を食べた)猫  

The cat that ate a fish and the cat had a red head.  

  

((顔が赤い)魚)を食べた猫  

The cat that ate a fish and the fish had a red head.  

  

(顔が(赤い魚)を食べた)猫  

The cat whose head ate a red fish.  

  

顔が((赤い魚)を食べた猫)  

The head is a cat that ate a red fish.  

  

顔が赤い((魚を食べた)猫)  

The head is a red cat that ate a fish.
Coming up in the next lesson, an auxiliary verb is a verb that attaches to another verb and gives meaning to that verb instead of having its own meaning.


Normal verbs like いる sometimes act as auxiliary verbs. Japanese japanese grammar distinguishes between auxiliary verbs that can **either** act normally **or** as auxiliaries, and auxiliary verbs that must **only** act as auxiliaries. So いる is sometimes called a "subsidiary" verb instead of auxiliary, even in english. In this guide we'll call them auxiliary when they're used that way, instead of treating "auxiliary verb" like a part of speech.




#### Lesson 12: Irregular verbs and basic formality


Now that we've covered the most common verb stems, we can cover the irregular verbs. Japanese only has two blatant irregular verbs, but they're very common. Their conjugations are completely irregular.


する, meaning "do"  

来る くる, meaning "come"  

  

する した しない せよ  

くる　きた　こない　こい
The irregular imperatives are so irregular that casual spoken japanese sometimes uses completely different imperatives altogether. They're not formally correct, but you'll run into them anyway.


しろ・くれ
Many more verbs have one or two irregular conjugations, but する and くる take the cake and are the most important to know about for reading.


Let's cover basic formality while we're at it. Basic polite verbs use an auxiliary verb, ます, attached to a stem. For one-form verbs, ます attaches to the One True Base. For five-form verbs, change the u to an i, then attach ます.


食べます (Someone) eats/will eat.  

行きますよ I'm heading out!  

切ります Cuts [something] (polite)
Warning: don't attach ます to です, it doesn't work.


In lesson 8, we mentioned that the five-form past tense comes from this "i" stem. That version is "reduced". Let's review.


死んだ　shi n da  

死にます　shi ni ma su  

殺した　koro sh ta  

殺します　koro shi ma su
Notice that the "i" is not pronounced in 殺した. You can pronounce it, but it'll sound weird. 死んだ removes the "i" completely, even in spelling. Also, the ん in 死んだ causes the た to become "voiced", た to だ, the same thing that turned にて into で.


Here's a comparison between the past tense and ます form of each type of five-form verb. Don't memorize this.




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 切る | 殺す | 死ぬ | 選ぶ | 読む | 買う | 問う | 動く | 急ぐ | 持つ |
| 切ります | 殺します | 死にます | 選びます | 読みます | 買います | 問います | 動きます | 急ぎます | 持ちます |
| 切った | 殺した | 死んだ | 選んだ | 読んだ | 買った | 問うた | 動いた | 急いだ | 持った |


And these are the basic conjugations of ます.


死にます　死にました　死にません　死にませんでした
ません doesn't have a past tense of its own. To use the past tense with ません, you attach でした, the past tense of です.




#### Intermission: Keigo and some archaic speech


*Intermissions are optional.*


Keigo is a prescribed way of using japanese that encodes information about respect, humility, and politeness. Some of the politeness mechanisms of normal japanese (like ます and です) overlap with keigo, but keigo goes beyond that.


Keigo makes strict distinctions between politeness, respectfulness, and humility, and also adds mechanisms for "word beautification". We'll cover the normal ways to do some of this later on, but keigo is a level above what the normal language does.


In keigo, certain phrases act as alternatives to normal words, and they have different levels of respectfulness, humility, politeness, beauty, etc. Because this is prescribed, not all japanese speakers understand it 100%, but everyone's aware of the basics and the fact that it exists.


These phrases basically act like euphemisms for normal words. These phrases are usually longer than what they replace (since longer = more formal), and since they're basically euphemisms, they're kind of nonliteral/indirect. If you know that keigo exists, you'll be less confused when you run into them.


Here's an example of the keigo versions of the word する "do":


なさる (respectful)　いたす (humble)　します (polite)
Keigo cares about your social status compared to other people, which is why there's several categories and why it's prescribed.


Keigo is basically a register of speech. Just like someone living in a slum would be totally out of touch with the way the language used in a cathedral, someone who learned japanese playing video games would be mostly out of touch if they ended up in a business meeting. Of course, a game will probably use keigo, but not in the right ways for you to acquire it.


On the subject of registers of speech, you will occasionally run into things like よりて where よって normally goes, using the unreduced version of the stem described in Lesson 12, but this is basically exclusive to intentionally archaic writing.
