<i>No use going back to yesterday, because you were a different person then.</i>

All things must end. The time loop has been broken. Saving the world of tomorrow. Giving our future back. And so, too, must there be no yesterday.


The End

<b>作日 Sakubi: Raised in a day ― The Day It Was Made</b>


There's no yesterday. No past self we once were.


There's nowhere to get stuck. No such thing as looking back.


We are who we are. We do what we do. We learn japanese.


See you tomorrow.
